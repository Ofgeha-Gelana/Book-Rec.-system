a book of one's own,"good book. well-written. all about the different types of diarists and dairy purposes, including chronicling, traveling, apologizing, and creating, to name a few. he weaves together each chapter with samples and narratives about famous and not-so famous diaries. for example, anne frank is discussed at length at the end of the book. i learned a lot from this book, and seeing that i myself am primarily a diarist, it was good reading. i consider myself to be the type of diarist that creates an alternate world to the one i am living in. the more i read my own diary, the more i see myself in all my various moods and forms. i see my obsessions and my habits.$i really enjoyed this overview of more than one hundred diaries. mallon groups the diaries into categories of writers and their circumstances and shows that diaries can serve many purposes. some record travels, others confinement, some religious development and others creative, some are used to argue a point of view whilst others are used as cofessionals.$i really loved this book. mallon is definitely a bit of a wordy intellectual, and can overanalyze (almost to the point of cruelty) some of the diaries and diarists. he often assumes too much of the reader, dropping names and events for context that don't always come to my little mind. with that said, though, this is a wonderful look inside the different people and different reasons people write in journals and diaries. mallon has read (at least!) dozens of diaries and there are enough direct quotes from them to satisfy our voyeuristic nature! he also has points of extreme tenderness when it is obvious that mallon understands what it is to write you heart down on paper. he is quite witty at times, and laughs with us at the ridiculous, and admires the amazing and cradles the vulnerable.$this book is a survey of diaries, divided into types of diary keepers. among them are those who record the events of their time and their own adventures, those who keep track of ideas, and those who create a world to live in because they cannot live fully in the physical world. mallon is a charming guide. he has made an effort to supply us with metaphors stretched almost to the point of goofiness. $a fun read indeed! conversational, witty, erudite, as interested in the diaries of famous poets as those of their overshadowed spouses and siblings. mallon slips through the pages of chroniclers, travelers, pilgrims, creators, confessors, prisoners, and apologists with ease, contributing empathetic, critical, and humorous commentary. at the very least, peruse the introduction!$i love reading people's journals and diaries. i have kept a journal or a diary my entire life but not faithfully, daily but scattered. i started this book, again, and instantly had the urge to underline. i resisted for a chapter or two and then went back and started reading from the beginning and underlined everything that appealed and also made a list of all the diarists listed so i could check out their books or mark the ones already read in my lifetime. $"
a catskill eagle,"really liked the storyline, with spenser and hawk traveling outside boston to get done what they need to do to make things right.for raymond this novel spenser gets side-tracked with his morals which up to now have be steady and firm. he does what needs to be done though for the betterment of everyone, but there's a subtle change in him. $this is robert parker's masterpiece. it is easily the best of all the spenser novels (and many of them are very, very good).the characters are nuanced, there are many shades of grey, yet parker's wonderful wit is still there.this is the spenser novel that should have been made into a feature film.$yes, the book is good, but all the elements are here that will lead to the bad books to come: the absence of real plot, the reliance on action and hollywood action movie cliches as a substitute, and susan-susan-susan. all the time. "
a life of one's own by joana field,"the author explores over a period of seven years the things that made her happy. the book seems so deep like one of those studies in psychoanalysis. for some reason i feel that jung would have made excellent use of her book as a case study in consciousness, unconsciousness, and psychoanalysis. i could see jungian thinking in her comparison of thinking as a male and thinking as a female and how we seem to have both in us.$i loved this book. ""joanna field"" (marion milner) does a great job of revealing her insights on her path to personal discovery in incredible (yet somehow not yawn-inducing) detail.one of the most fascinating things that i pulled from reading ""a life of one's own"" was that her conclusions about certain mindsets and behaviors seem to draw upon eastern ways of thinking.a lot$outstanding! an engaging record of self-discovery through the author's exploration of her own thought processes, begins by asking questions about what would make her happy. notion of ""blind thinking,"" efforts to pay attention and train one's thoughts, extension of understanding to appreciation and personal relationships. body awareness through breathing exercises and relaxation informs the journey.$the journey of self-discovery is exactly that = self. one cannot simply take the words, actions and knowledge from another and transfer it to one' own life. the journey must be internalized and personalized. just as with reading literature, we all take from it our own perceptions (good or bad) and weave the piece of literature into our own lives. $this is one of the most introspective books i have ever read, though painstaking at times, but marion milner's insights into her own life and mind rae profound. it was originally published in 1934, but her life experience feels so similar to anyones. marion milner writes this wholly from her own life experience, trying to answer the questions,$it was a difficult book for me to get into at first. i would keep putting it down and picking it up, i was determined to finish it!the diary like entries and writing were not my cup of tea. i did warm to the concept and the book did provoke me to think about the concepts and taking the time to reflect. $"
a tale of the ragged mountains,"i am glad i read this. an idiosyncratic tale with a twilight zone-like atmosphere.towards the end i started to realize that what happened is all about reincarnation — getting a glimpse of the past.it could also be a different thing altogether. what if it was just the influence of drugs that he began to experience all that? $this story is very vague. i like it because there are a bunch of possible explanations for the ending that are running through my mind but. it's difficult for me to really figure out an explanation though because the story is just a bit too vague.$i love poe, but this is not one of his best. the story has definite potential, but it's too easy to spot the ending (or at least most of the ending) way ahead of time. being only four and half pages long, it feels a lot like a work in progress.$interesting story. not like most of his stories. i enjoyed it near the end, though the beginning struggled to keep my interest.$this was an interesting story about reincarnation or something. i was a little confused to be honest.$"
a voice of her own,"reviewed by cat for teensreadtoo.com.despite a huge body of work and lifetime's worth of correspondence she left behind, emily dickinson remains an enigma in many people's minds. why was she so preoccupied with death? why did she choose to not marry in an era when most women did so to the exclusion of all other pursuits? what drove her to write more than one thousand poems, yet never seek publication for her work?i finished this one out of sheer force of will and desire to be done with it. had i not been reading this for a class i would have put it down. there just wasn't much of a plot, it was just moments of emily dickinson growing up. yes, there was the overarching theme of her developing her identity as a poet, but that was it. the book didn't build up to anything; it just kind of was. i realize that real life is not always as adventurous as the books i like to read and emily's growing up years may have been rather average, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring. laura ingllas led a typical pioneer life, but her little house on the prairie books are excellent. something is always happening and you grow attached to the characters. i couldn't connect to emily or anyone else in the book and it moved so slowly.$despite a huge body of work and lifetime's worth of correspondence she left behind, emily dickinson remains an enigma in many people's minds. why was she so preoccupied with death? why did she choose to not marry in an era when most women did so to the exclusion of all other pursuits? what drove her to write more than one thousand poems, yet never seek publication for her work?$the form of first-person narrative seems totally appropriate for an actress, accustomed to taking on a role, to adopt as a writer. this memoir is totally believable - it does seem to capture dickinson's voice and likely thoughts: the frequent use of exclamation points, the quiet personal confession of pride or jealous feelings, the astonishment at even little things in the natural world. i appreciate its presentation as fictional. $i loved the language of the novel and a lot of the imagery, but that only carried me through the first third of the book. after that, the plot seemed to go in circles, never really going anywhere. i guess that's inevitable when you are writing about someone's life (you can't just make stuff up, after all, and in real life there's no tidy story arc, with a climax at just the right point), but after a while, it got old. i wanted to say, ""okay, get to the point already. what, you don't have one?!""$"
absolution gap,"please don't start with this book as it's number three (sort of) in the series, and the book imho is perhaps not the best way to introduce yourself to mr.reynolds. ""absolution gap"" though being a marvelous addition to the series is not as outright amazing as it's predictors, though a book you will want to read if you read the others.$this is the fourth novel i've ready by alastair reynolds, and i have to admit that while it took me a bit of time to get into the writing, the effort is never wasted. the build-up is slow but very steady, and i can honestly say that the final explosions are quite good. there's always something else to look forward to, on the other hand, and i suppose my only wish would be to have a prolific amount of works to support each one.$impressive and interesting conclusion to the revelation space trilogy. at first i was a little disappointed by the low key ending, but after a couple of days i find this perfectly human ending, very appropriate and satisfying.$this is the weakest of the revelation space novels, which is a shame, because it is the last and it ends more with a whimper than a bang. there are two main flaws; one is that it doesn't really end the story of humanity's encounter with the inhibitors at all and that feels unsatisfactory. there is a clear need for a fourth book to wrap things up properly, but we aren't going to get it. "
acccelerando,"this book starts off with a headache inducing deluge of acronyms and technogadgetideas, some of which are well known realities now. it's something that might be familiar to readers of some other stross books, for instance the ones set in a near future scotland e.g. halting state. a geek-guru makes a living from freebies given by grateful companies he puts in touch with other grateful companies in order to realise whatever mad idea he's come up with next.$this book is fantastic hard scifi in the emergent post-human genre. from what i can gather, this book has done for post-humanism what neuromancer did for cyberpunk. it's a touch dry in some places and the characters are a bit clunky, but i feel charles is most interested in describing the ""singularity"" rather than telling a traditional story.$the first third of this book is a five star white knuckle fall off the cliff ever accerating drop into the singularity. it's fascinating, breathtaking, horrifying, belivable and plausible. you're never quite sure what's coming, and you never catch your breath, but you're never completely lost either."
an evil cradling,"it is a rare occasion that you get to read a book that manages to surprise you from beginning to end. i didn’t expect anything out of it, but i still discovered i had a number of expectations, because i discovered them whilst i was reading something that seemed to contradict what i subconsciously thought. $it is a rare occasion that you get to read a book that manages to surprise you from beginning to end. i didn’t expect anything out of it, but i still discovered i had a number of expectations, because i discovered them whilst i was reading something that seemed to contradict what i subconsciously thought.$deeply powerful and evocative, a book that takes you into the soul of despair - unlike and to the extent that no other book i have read quite compares (or at present comes to mind) - while at the same time stands as a testimony to the indefatigable human spirit of the author, which hauls his mind countless times out of the mire, regenerating from within always a renewed sense of hope, rallying with courage enough to at times strike fear into his captors.$one of the most moving and perspective shifting books i have ever read. keenan's story of captivity and exposure to a very broken segment of human society is highly topical in this day and age. anyone who would seek to defend imprisonment without trial should read and consider this man's experiences.$absolutely astonishing. the human spirit is iron strong in this true life depiction of being held hostage in beirut for four pain-staking years. his tenacity & fierce refusal to submit to senseless torture was mind-blowing. so beautifully written, i found myself re-reading paragraphs for their sheer brilliance. his mind, clearly strengthened through the horror, was remarkable."
an obedient father,"this is an easy-to-read, very difficult book. sharma does not shy away from the ugliest, most difficult subjects but writes about them so fluidly that you find yourself going along at a steady clip, jaw dropping wider and wider. much like the subjects of abuse in this book, the reader at times can feel like he's in an abusive relationship he just can't pull away from. that's not meant to demean or minimize actual abuse victims suffer. it's only meant to highlight how deftly sharma captures abuse of all kind (institutional, familial, cultural, structural) and grabs your attention with it.$despite this book's horrific subject manner, there was a bit of genius in the writing. while the reader is inside the head of the main character, who, to put it nicely, is a vile man, the reader both loathes and somehow can feel some pity for him, once all of his sins catch up with him. while reading this, you know everything he has done is reprehensible but, because you are reading it from his perspective, you almost feel sorry for him when he gets what he pretty much deserves. getting the reader to feel this way is pretty remarkable. the author was able to keep this balance because he allowed us inside ram's daughter's head as well (and allowing us to get out of ram's head made it a bit easier to read). it is interesting to read the political and cultural piece to this as well. sadly, it was interesting in a psychological aspect because it shows the reader why some families stay together, despite abuse this despicable and the result it can have on keeping the victim a victim and how that plays out with the next generation. the end tied it all together as well. it was a difficult book to read and phantom. if it weren't so well written, i am not sure if i could have finished. it is not for the weak of heart.$this is not an easy book to review;nor is it easy to read. the main character, an overweight alcoholic, political crook and child molester, tells most of the story from his point of view. although he is mostly a vile man, there are some times you forget yourself and feel some sympathy towards him.he molests his oldest daughter, anita, when she was 12. twenty years later, anita is a widow with a young daughter of her own. she is forced to take her daughter and move in with her father, who she has grown to hate deeply.  she is increasingly paranoid that he may attempt to molest her daughter. amidst this story are stories of political corruption and intrigue that her father is involved in. i enjoy indian fiction, and although this novel is a little crazy at times, i love sharma's writing. his characters are so well drawn that i can practically picture them.$the write-up on the back of the edition that i read describes sharma's protagonist as a bit of a dostoevskyian anti-hero. this makes sense: sharma gives us a corrupt, alcoholic, child-molesting bureaucrat as the vehicle through which most of the story is told. and-call me old fashioned-this makes the story just that much harder to get through; any time you have a protagonist so wretched, so miserable, so abhorrent that you are viscerally—even physically—angered by them. well, good luck finishing; you are unlikely to enjoy the story."
ariadne's thread,"until reading ariadne's thread, i had only been exposed to books on witchcraft that followed the more wiccan traditions. this workbook opened my eyes to alternate magical beliefs and showed me that i could cut my own spiritual path, rather than trying to force my magic into rigid practices that weren't working for me.$ loved this book! accidentally found it after accidentally finding shekhinah's cool womanrunes system. enjoying reading older books on goddess spirituality lately. lots of great stuff to be gleaned from less well-known works.$shekhinah mountainwater is clearly an intelligent writer. she proposes theories, ideas, and concepts related to a matriarchal and woman-centric spirituality through a well-reasoned, articulate lens. at the same time, she intersperses her clearly female-centric, anti-patriarchy agenda with evidence she has gathered from works of fiction as frequently as from works of evidence. on the one hand, this type of evidence could be said to spring from the sacred well of intuition that has been usurped and sullied by patriarchal forms of scholarship. that is, folklore, which was often a medium for extending scholarship through narrative, has been denigrated to whimsy and fairy stories by the modern-day institutions of academia, while self-perpetuating historical analyses that reference and reflect only other (and perhaps popular) forms of scholarship are seen as somehow more real. as an academic, i tend to temper my view of scholarship through the lens of both/and in that it would be foolish of me to presume that folk-derived evidence is somehow inaccurate to its roots whereas science is the only truth.if that were the case, well. perhaps pluto is a planet? i mean, i have never been there myself, so.$ found this book in the library when i was eleven. my first introduction to paganism. i ordered it for myself last year when i found it online, for sentimental value and to attempt reading it again."
arms and the man,"this is one of my favorite plays. i had the good fortune to see a pretty well done production at university, so i already knew the plot and language of the play. this is a superb comedy, right up there with the importance of being earnest, among the best plays of the late victorian period. this period seems to be (at least to me) the era when dry british humor really came to dominate english comedy and mark it as a distinct and recognizable genre, and shaw's play definitely maes use of that kind$the plays have a special effect on the readers. we imagine them as plays while we read understanding the dialogues the feelings the expressions. it is as if we are acting all the acts and our heart goes along with the play.and i should assure everyone this play of gb shaw is a remarkable one, with adventure, beautiful turn of events and above all the sweetness of an english romance. i am not good in rating a play, but i can't give anything less than the best to this.$what a great play. while it makes fun of the military, the chocolate-cream soldier is one i would follow into battle. if you enjoy snooty people getting their due, and love winning out, enjoy. the satire is as pointed today as it was in the 1890s.$an excellent play by shaw! the fecundity of war and the hypocrisy and pretentiousness of society have been ridiculed by such a simple and clever plot. the swiss chocolate cream soldier, captain blanchly, is a most intriguing character, in my opinion one of the most memorable in modern theatre.$i really enjoyed this play and found it to be quite humorous. i want to call it a satire, but really it is the complete opposite. shaw portrays characters so realistically without exaggerating their flaws, yet his characterization and clever dialogue expose the fact that, as sergius puts it, ""life's a farce."" "
at a journal workshop by ira progoff,"it is really wordy -- so many extra words to say the least little thing that it's distracting me from the kernel of the book. expanding this edition was probably a mistake. it could use serious cutting, at least 50%.$i have started my journal work using progoff s method for the second time. i was unable to keep in the process the first time, but i still have those entries, like old records to return to and ponder over. incredibly, what i was able to accomplish during that chaotic time is valuable today as a teaching tool, when i am at a crossroads in my life.$this is a very deep, soulful work. it is definitely not light reading, as others have said, but do not let that deter you from trying to understand and use it. perhaps because i am so accustomed to reading jungian books, (which tend to be complex and lengthy) i did not find this book difficult to understand. the introduction is beautifully written with many quote worthy sections. i can immediately sense how this book was written with meticulous care and profound meaning.$a very difficult book - not so much in the subject matter, but in the way it is been written and organised. it is so dense and rambly that i found it very difficult to work out the actual writing exercises and practices. perhaps it would be more useful if i attend one of the courses around which the book is based. as it is, i cannot gauge its usefulness at this point. $this is not an easy book to read and comprehend. i read it once and then took the workshop.wrote and read some more.and then took the workshop again. i met a woman there who took the workshop yearly as long as it was offered in the area. i stopped after 2.$i had purchased a copy of this book years ago, at a time in my life when i thought that the rigorous methodology of journal writing described would be of benefit to me. i did not finish the book at that time, nor did i undertake to follow the methodology; both for unrelated reasons. nevertheless, i believe that keeping a journal is highly beneficial, and liked many of the author's ideas. so i retained the book, thinking to try it again at some other time in my life.$"
between_planets,"one of my favorite juvenile heinlein novels. while in school on earth, don receives a message to immediately leave school to join his parents on mars where they are station to do some sort of research as a war is brewing between earth and the new ""republic of venus"". don's trip is interrupted due to a war declaration. $heinlein's story of a young adult finishing school on earth before heading home to mars, only to find himself stranded by a war between earth and venus, has always been a favorite. i'm writing this after reading it in 2014 with the kids, and surprisingly this is probably their least favorite of the heinlein that i've introduced them to.$i thought this book was really dumb. this is probably the book i disagree with my father most over. normally i let my opinion of a book settle before judging, & if i keep thinking of it years later then that's a great book. i only keep thinking of this book as ""that bad book my father liked for some reason""$this book has an interesting story and the action never stops. however, it was obviously written in the 1950s. it is really amazing that it has held up as well as it has.$this is one of heinlein's juvenile novels. that said, there's a couple of somewhat more adult portions, so i'd recommend that younger children shouldn't read it. at least not without having some an interesting discussion or two. but, since the main character is a older teenager, it's more aimed towards that age range."
beyond the mexique bay,"the book starts with an amazing description of what life will be in the future. after that first chapter everything goes down hill, and i felt emotional pain for each extra page i had to go through. perfect for masochists, and if you are latino and really like racism and ""malinchism"" then this book is for you.$i loved this book. it started me on a binge of huxley which i still haven't finished. the book ambles from one central american country to the next in a very leisurely manner that suggests what travel must have been like then.$it's his travelogue of a trip he took to guatemala and mexico in the early 30s. his observations of the culture and people are occasionally interesting, but on the whole shockingly arrogant, condescending and patronizing. he repeatedly emphasizes the ugliness of the indians, their goods, and their buildings, often treating them as if they were sub-human. one of the most egregious passages: ""indian men are often handsome;$i made it less than one hundred pages into this before the racism, condescension and general disgust for mankind (especially those not fortunate enough to be born into an incredibly wealthy and influential aristocratic family) became too much for me. i was looking forward to when huxley made his way towards the part of guatemala that i was once fortunate enough to call home, but despair set in when he took time away from praising colonialism to mock women from guatemala city for not keeping up"
blue remembered earth,"i loved this optimistic feel to the whole book, a nice breath of fresh air from all the post-apocalyptic and dystopia (although i do like those genres) and it's a credit to the author that he had the insight to use this perspective to such great effect.$the novel is a typical sherlock holmes follow the not-so-obvious clues tale. in order to maintain reader interest, however there must be a hint that something very important lies at the end of the trail. this element is missing in blue remembered earth. the industrialist scions worry about a secret that might hurt the business. since the reader has neither emotional nor intellectual interest in the business, this means very little. the semi-outcasts feel that some interesting clue regarding mysterious aspects of the personal life of the matriarch might be found.$i do love mr. reynolds' voice as a writer, the undertones of melancholy, like someone that still spends hours looking into the night sky! and then how can you not appreciate his subtle humor when you get sentences like this: ""the zookeepers could be overwhelming until you built up sufficient exposure tolerance. sunday had passed that point years ago: the wilder excesses of their starry-eyed idealism now ghosted through her like a flux of neutrinos. ""$all of reynolds novels are magical mystery tours where plots and characters matter less than lushly-imagined scenery, deftly-mixed science fact and scientific speculation, and broad social/philosophical themes. in this book, reynolds sides with the techno-optimists who believe that humanity, with our collective backs up against the wall, will find ways to blunt the worst aspects of climate change, find new sources of clean energy, and boldly go where science fiction has repeatedly gone before$the book's biggest problem has to do with the narrative thread that ties it together, the search for granny's secret. unfortunately, the thread is actually a trail of breadcrumbs that granny painstakingly planted all around the solar system. it's one thing to acquaint readers with an unfamiliar world through the investigation of a crime (as in ""the prefect"" or ""house of suns""), and it's something else entirely to drag the reader through a chain of deliberately designed puzzles a la ""national treasure"". the former can feel organic, but the latter is always silly and artificial. that's ok in the ""indiana jones"" films, but not in a serious novel."
by the light of the green star  ,"the first is endemic to the series: i'm having trouble imagining the treetop cities. they're described as being jewel boxes perched on the limbs of five mile high trees, but i can't wrap my head around how a city-sized structure would sit there given the assumed scale. this would be a minor concern except that carter periodically mentions the cities and sets events there, and i can't get a good picture in my head of what this actually looks like.$the green star books was lin carter's best series in my opinion. good action and, although there are a lot of similarities to erb's work, i thought carter achieved some pretty good originality here. this is number 3 in the series.$alright, i've read better books, but i've read far worse. i don't have the rest of the series, so there's no telling if reading them would change my views. honestly, it was an enjoyable story, but there were a few things that frankly irritated me. first was the reiterating of information multiple times in the same book. it became rather monotonous hearing exactly how they got a specific item or met a certain person several times in the same book. once is enough for me to grasp it and remember it. lin also seemed to have a hard time writing the female personality.$though the first half of this book dragged (the first half of the book should have been condensed down to a few chapters) by the end i was more involved with the characters than the last book and i can't help but want to read the next. $"
cabbages and kings,"this has got to be among the best reads describing the odd friendship between colonialism and business interests, staged on the backdrop of latin america, with the original banana republic of anchuria. i landed up reading this after i learnt that this is where the term banana republic originated from. a free copy on project gutenberg and i could not stop reading this book once i started.$this is by far my favorite short story collection by o. henry. the tales take place in the same locale, a fictitious banana republic of the american tropics. there is an over-arcing plot that runs through the stories, concerning the ruling potentate's abdication and sudden departure with the nation's treasury funds, creating a mystery that isn't solved until the final vignette. along the way, we meet an amusing cast of characters, each one with his own colorful background.$i love o. henry. he had a unique grammar and diction. this book is a chain a short stories that could just as easily be called a novel. but i think the contrivances at the end, which are meant to tie the thing together, rather undermine the charm of the book.$ i was somewhat disappointed because the volume was actually a collection of short stories with a common theme, that of political events in honduras seen from a ""gringo"" point of view. o. henry's style is lively, and one learns a lot about u.s. society of the fin de siecle.$o.henry at his worst set of short stories. i couldnt find a relation between the stories as there was supposed to be some relation somewhere as i had heard. only thing was stories drifted from one person to other with some small link, but totally there was no sense in any story. "
carrion comfort,"i like long books, and carrion comfort is very long. clocking in at 886 pages, it isn't the longest i have read, either. the tiny typeface may have shortened the page count, though. i would love to find out the word count of this book. i say all this not to criticize the book (as you can see, i rated it 5 stars) but to explain why it took forever to read it.$this book! *covers eyes* oh my god! i don't know how to feel about it. dan simmons is such a great writer and his imagination scares me, like really, really bad! the stuff in this book was crazy! i couldn't believe what i was reading. sometimes i didn't even want to know where this story was going. but despite the horrific plot, one thing that simmons does really well is character building and backstory.$i must say; after reading this book, i am completely disheveled in appearance and spent. this book wore me out to say the least. this was a thrill ride of the highest order, and creeped me out the entire time. i don't want to give away anything and provide spoilers; for fear that 'someone' may find this out and complete a mind-game on me.$i always hesitate to say a book is overlong. i read because i like knowing the deepest thoughts and motivations of the characters who populate my fiction. books are meant to be longer, more in-depth experiences. there are thousands of studies that have been done on chapter and novel length, but the truth of the matter is: a reader only notices page count when the writing and/or story sucks. $there is no doubt that simmons is a great storyteller, able to write in a variety of genres, most notably horror, historical, and science fiction, and all with a skill for creating incredibly human characters in realistic situations. his words flow very well and his pacing is to my liking. "
cemetery world,"i loved this. a woman historian, robots who'd lived 1000s of years, ghosts, and a post-apocalyptic earth that had been reborn. the book reminded me most of peter beagle's work. there was a gentleness to the characters and the setting that despite the context made it feel comforting. it had some definite science fiction tropes but played them out in a wonderfully unique and interesting way. i am definitely going to read everything else i can find by this author.$my gosh this book was pretty terrible. i went into it with an open mind having read nothing else by this author. the whole story is a disaster, so very poorly put together that the badness at one point changes to pure laughs. sadly it is not intended to be funny...$i thought this would be a book about a visit back to old earth, where the characters would comb through the detritus of the past. possibly they would meet an old robot or hologram... i expected it to be full of sf tropes. instead it's a silly pulp action sf novel. extremely boring and doesn't resemble simak at all. $rather disappointing - i was told simak is one of the best at sci-fi, and all i saw in this book was adventures. which is not bad to read, but nothing more. not to speak about the idiotic discussions of the characters which were supposed to be a bit more intelligent than that.$lightly disappointed with the ending, but on the while a ""ripping good yarn"". a lot of detail (too muc?), delivered via expository dialogue which helps keep the page count down, but can jar a bit.seems more a product of the sixties than the seventies, surprised it was published 73, seems older than that, somehow."
citizen of the galaxy,"this is considered (by most anyway) to be one of heinlein's youth or teen books. however the subject matter and the story telling are on an adult level and i don't think any science fiction fan who tries this one will be disappointed. $this book was incredibly jarring. i felt like robert heinlein had a good idea...then he had another one...then he had another one. and since he liked all three of them, he decided ""what the hell!"" and combined them. the book features a boy named thorby. at the beginning of the book, he is sold as a slave to a beggar man. the beggar man (surprise) turns out to be more then he appears. he trains up thorby and turns him into a super smart and clever beggar.$i liked this book less and less, the more i listened to it (be warned: the narrator's accents are occasionally awful) and after i finished it, the more i thought and read about it. there is a dusting of libertarian thought, not a philosophy i personally find very attractive - an anthropologist with a hideous southern accent - remember, i was listening to this - spouts some libertarian thought about mid-way through that made me scratch my head. $this is my favourite of all heinlein's juveniles. there is an added bit of sophistication to this one. heinlein's juveniles are a cut above the rest (asimov, leinster, silverberg, norton and the many other scifi authors of the fifties gave this sub-genre a shot - the appeal, i suppose, is that if the book was successful, you'd get a hardcover edition into all the public school libraries...) as he never dumb down his story or narrative to his younger audience."
clouds of witness,"this isn't my favorite of the lord peter novels – but as i'm sure i've said somewhere, that's like being my least favorite chocolate or my least favorite beatle. and this does have some of my favorite peter-bunter scenes, and gave me the name for one of my blogs$i just love lord peter. very frivolous, but totally serious about his crime-solving! in a way, he's like columbo. (not fashion, obviously.) he is underestimated by his adversary because of the front he puts to the world, but when you come right down to it, they're doomed. in this story, we learn more about lord peter and his family when a murder comes to the heart of his aristocratic family. very fun what with adultery, card sharps, elopements and soviets!$this novel really gives you a look at peter and his family. there is not enough of the dowager duchess but it's fun getting to know his siblings. bunter is someone i want in my life. he runs peter's bath water, brings him breakfast in bed and pulls him out of quicksand.$this is the second book in the lord peter wimsey series, and much better than the first one. this novel casts light on wimsey's family relationships, as his elder brother, gerald, the duke of denver, is accused of murdering the fiancé of their sister, lady mary.peter tries to remain as lighthearted as ever while joining forces with his friend, inspector parker, to investigate the killing. but it's clear that, below the sparkling surface, he is worried about his family, determined to clear his brother and bewildered as to what secrets both gerald and mary are hiding. so already in this second book the character of one of the greatest golden age amateur detectives is starting to deepen."
cover her face,"was able to finish this book but couldn't really care how it ended up - not one redeeming character and very little development of the detective. i'm assuming this is because this is a series so why make me like the detective and want me to read more about him and his cases. . .don't focus on him but rather the boring, selfish other 'suspects' and 'victim'. to be fair i should read at least one more in the series to see if it gets better (based on other reviews it sounds like it gets better). however, reading another in this series is far down on my list.$i believe this was p. d. james's first detective novel, and it is an amazing piece of work for a debut. it reads like, and is, more of a novel rather than the simpler, sketchier, slightly dumbed-down style more common in the genre. yet there is nothing highbrow or deliberately precious about it.the characters are well developed. the various conflicts and motivations of the characters are interesting and well developed as well$i enjoyed this visit back to the first mystery series i ever picked up in my late teens. sometimes, it's a good thing that my memory is so poor, as this felt like a first-time read. i love the way james writes. she has a great sense of place, and is able to concisely communicate various people's states of mind amazingly well. she is also able to manage this equally well from a man's or a woman's point of view. $a nice introduction to inspector dalgleish. i found the first third of the book rather dull. all i wanted was a dead body. but it took forever to kill off sally. (not a spoiler as if says who died in the blurb on the back of the book). i didn't guess the killer which comes as no surprise as i never can tell whodunnit."
dreamsnake,"while this book gets docked a point or two for the cheesy 70s cover and the title, it deserves a place among the classics of the genre. i first read the nebula-winning novella of mist, and grass, and sand, in middle school, but i never realized that mcintyre had expanded it to novel length. it's a thoughtful adventure, a quest led by a mature and confident heroine, snake. i love her as a character: she knows who she is, she is good at what she does, and she is comfortable in her own skin. i also love that this book is not your typical post-apocalyptic nightmare. it takes place so long after a nuclear catastrophe that society has rebuilt itself, albeit in a very different form. this lets mcintyre present us with a familiar but somewhat alien landscape, advanced and regressive technology, humans acting human but according to slightly different societal rules, all with lots of room to explore. while there are a couple of elements that seem as dated as the cover, all in all i thought mcintyre did a beautiful job of expanding that original story into the larger tale told here.$a very odd book by modern standards, but one that is strikingly of its era. manages to do some things very badly (dialogue, most of the characterisation (the central character is solid and likeable but a mary sue and not all that distinctive, while the supporting cast are mostly two(or fewer)-dimensional and also somewhat msish), a lot of the plot details), yet do others very well (descriptive prose; setting and its exploration, some of the emotional stuff).$it's been quite a while since i read this, and i remembered it fondly enough, so when it came up on netgalley, i decided to request it and do a reread. i only gave it three stars the first time, which surprised me when i looked it up and saw the raft of awards it got: nebula, hugo, tiptree nomination, national book award finalist… i remembered it being quite like the steerswoman in the narrative style, in the capable heroine; i remembered that the background of the story including queer and polyamorous characters in a casual, natural way — as well as plenty of capable women who knew what they were doing, who talked to each other (about things other than men!), who worked together.$snake is a healer on her proving year, travelling the vaguely post-apocalyptic landscape (there is always a vague apocalypse) to treat illness and injury using the venom of her snakes, but when her dreamsnake is killed she must find a new source for the extremely rare creature or she will no longer be able to work as a healer."
emperors of the twilight,"i enjoyed evi's character and her development throughout the story. she's about as deep as nohar's character, so not too great but not bad either.the story was exciting and kept me interested all the way to the end. there were lots of action scenes and they were described well allowing me to visualize all the action easily. overall, not something that i would want to read over and over but it was exciting and quick to read. 3 out of 5 stars.$emperors of the twilight was a decent book (following forests of the night.it was exciting to dive back into the world where humans, moreaus, and franks lived. this book was chock full of action, mystery, and romance like the forests of the night (or fotn for short). it follows the same story line (picking up after the events in fotn) six years later with a different main character.$not as good as the first book, but still good enough. continues the plot with a different interesting angle. where the first book concentrated on a detective/noir theme, this one's main character is a cia agent and the theme is more mystery/conspiracy. nohar was a better main character then evi is, still it's a fun light read - i like the world in which these books take place, with it's anthropomorphic animals and genetically engineered beings, along with the humans (and of course aliens)."
endless night,"i usually read agatha christie to unwind, and although they always guarantee a highly enjoyable hour filled with chuckles and gasps, there is an element of 'lightness' and dismissal involved.well, that serves me right. this book smacked the patronizing smirk right off my face and i am drooling on the floor, well and truly humbled. written lightly, as always, but for the first time, the weight of evil - the kind of evil that wears perfume, goes shopping and is grumpy in the morning - makes its presence softly, sweetly known.$this is a chilling stand alone novel by agatha christie. endless night is quite different than agatha christie's poirot or marple series. the story is narrated by the main character, micheal rogers, a young man with grandeur ideas but with no obvious means of attaining it. he is fascinated with gipsy's acre - a plot of land in rural england that is said to be cursed by the gypsies who once lived there and who were driven away.$well, this is an interesting little oddity. if i'd picked this novel up blind, not knowing who the author was, then i think i could have got through the first few chapters without being able to guess. here is a narrator who is just so un-christie. for a start he's very much working class, your callow and unpolished drifter. a good looking and smooth-talking boy, who at points seemed to me like he'd strayed in from a joe orton play. the tone is very un-christie too, and michael roberts – the narrator in question – reminded me of some of jim thompson's more gauche protagonists. (dusty rhodes in ‘a swell looking babe' came to mind.) this is a not very bright lad who thinks he's smart at points, but doesn't have as keen a grip on the world as he believes he does."
fire on the mountain,"nanda kaul is contentedly living out her twilight years in near-isolation in the indian hillstation of kasauli, until she receives a letter from her daughter advising that nanda's great-granddaughter, raka, is coming to stay. neither nanda nor raka is happy with this state of affairs, but nanda is the first to thaw. a visit from nanda's childhood friend, ila das, provides some gentle comic relief as well as the set-up for the shocking climax to this story$i was enjoying this so much, i was loving this and it made me happy as i read it, and then i reached the ending and i became bitter. that familiar feeling of loathing i held for so long towards ignorance and men rose like bile up my throat. i hate people. i hate men, specifically. i hate the way this book led me up to something happy and then dashed me down into something depressing.$the painstakingly created solitude of a nanda kaul is suddenly disturbed when her great granddaughter is sent to her for recuperation. discomfort soon turns to tenderness when the little one proves to be different from assumptions. a simple story but desai's skill at describing the life in the hills of kasauli and the sparse descriptions are going to be etched in memory for a long long time!$anita desai so far is one of the very few writers who is able to directly influence my mood through their work. should you see a tragic end, you too would feel so; if it were a heart-warming end, you too would be smiling. i really felt my mood change at the culmination scene. such an amazing writer she is! such a gripping tale this is. if not for anyone else, it was certainly relatable to me."
five point someone,"i purchased this book a while back from a book vendor whose little shop by the streets is a part of an open circulatory library sort of thing in my city. what happens in this circuit is that you buy a book for a negotiable price and return it later at any date and time and get half the price back for it. i normally buy these books and retain them with me because they are some pretty awesome buys for the price i pay for them.$the first time i picked up this book, it felt like i was going to do a great thing. dad had warned me not to read it, but being the reader i am, i took him lightly. until i found out the gross it contained.i knew definitely that it was not the best book in the world, that too far from my preferred genres: i had been a non fiction and self help lover then. i read it when i was probably twelve. i hated the idea to read it but finally, i heard some news about it being adapted as a film when i read it.$i must confess, this book is utter crap! its an insult to english language. its even worse than those soppy mushy crappy juvenile novels that i have seen my teenage friends gushing over!honestly, did bhagat ever edit his book??? perhaps he simply didnt have any idea of what to write.$another great piece of trash from cb. just because i could relate, a little bit, with the college life depicted; and because of mentioning pink floyd at one place; that this book has earned one extra star. $a good book should be written so that any age group can enjoy it. and although i'd say i am older than professor cherian, i can remember waiting on test results and definitely having the decision to make about how many hours to study. also, i have been on the other side of it giving assignments.$this book is seriously overrated. i was in class five when i first read this book. some of you might say that i was way too young to be reading such a book, but then we all need a break from kiddish stories once in a while in our childhood. i was in attending a school play (which was too long and pointless), when my eye caught this book in the hands of the girl next to me. she was definitely in class eight or nine. at that time the book was very, very popular since the movie was coming out and everyone wanted to know about the book as well. i had heard a lot about this book and so i begged the girl to let me read the book, promising her that i would take good care of it. as it turned out, the book wasn't that good at all. in fact the movie was way better.$"
god of small things,"okay, first things first. the god of small things is a very very clever book, but what makes it exceptional is that it is both beautiful and crafty, a rare combination. this book has structure. lots of it. she effectively creates a language of her own, a juvenile lucid language which complements the wistful mood of the book beautifully. the plot moves around in space and time with masterful ease and one can't help but experience a vague sense of foreboding, a prickly fear in the back of your neck$it is 1969 and india although having achieved independence twenty years earlier is still mired in its caste system. in this light, arundhati roy brings us her masterful first novel the g-d of small things which won the man booker prize in 1997. a powerful novel filled with luscious prose and a heart rending story, roy reveals to her readers an india hanging onto to the traditions of the past with a slight glimpse of her future. $it is 1969 and india although having achieved independence twenty years earlier is still mired in its caste system. in this light, arundhati roy brings us her masterful first novel the g-d of small things which won the man booker prize in 1997. a powerful novel filled with luscious prose and a heart rending story, roy reveals to her readers an india hanging onto to the traditions of the past with a slight glimpse of her future.$as i stand just outside the compound with the untended garden - an uninvited, random visitor - the darkened ayemenem house resembles a haunted mansion, belying the truth of the lives it once nurtured with maternal protectiveness in its cozy interiors. derelict. abandoned. forgotten.but i remember. i remember the lives lived, and the loves which were birthed by circumstances, loves which breathed for a while before perishing on the altar of conformity. $the god of small things won the booker prize in 1997, and i'd heard very good things about it. and yet i really didn't like it. it's not a bad book - far from it. the characters she has created are really wonderful, and she has succeeded in evoking all the noises and sights and smells of kerala, even for someone like me who's never been further east than poland. the narrative structure is disjointed, wandering from the now to 1969 and back again, but i never found myself getting confused by it."
gone with the wind,"it takes guts to make your main character spoiled, selfish, and stupid, someone without any redeeming qualities, and write an epic novel about her. but it works for two reasons. first of all you wait for justice to fall its merciless blow with one of the most recognized lines in cinema (frankly my dear, i don't give a damn), but you end with a broken and somewhat repentant character and you can't be pitiless. secondly, if you were going to parallel the beautiful, affluent, lazy, spirited south being conquered by the intellectual, industrious north, what better way to do that than with characters who embody those characteristics? you come to feel a level of sadness that the south and scarlett lost their war and hope that they will rebuild.$ honestly do not know whether to give this book 5 stars for being one of the most completely engrossing, shocking, and emotionally absorbing pieces of literature ever written, or to give it 0 stars for being the most tragic, unendingly upsetting, disturbing book i have ever read. i read the last 50 pages or so literally with my mouth wide open, unable to believe that it was really going to be that tragically sad. when i finally finished, i walked downstairs in a daze, handed the book to my husband, and told him to burn it and never let me see it again. throughout the book, i frantically kept reading, often until 2am or later, just to see when it would turn around and start getting happy, but there was never any redemption - it never got happy or uplifting. it just kept spiraling down, down, into despair. maybe after a few days i will be able to step back and give it a proper rating (i just finished it last night, and am still reeling from it)..$one of my reading themes for 2016 is reading at least ten classic books. it seems only fitting that on the fourth of july i completed margaret mitchell's gone with the wind, an epic masterpiece that many view as the definitive great american novel. $so much has been said in praise of this book it feels redundant to add more. in terms of the slave-holding society, the film actually toned-down the pro-south view of reconstruction (scarlett's second husband joined the kkk in the book) and mammy remains probably one of the most fully-developed and likeable african-american characters from 1930 you'll read."
great work of time,"great work of time is a story about people who travel through time. the plot centers on the british empire and its influence throughout its colonies, most specifically its african holdings. naturally, the actions of these time travelers have consequences that spread throughout the continuum of time and space, altering everything they touch.$a mind-boggling, highly literate take on time travel, the necessity of evil, and the character of british rule. it would be a mistake to dimiss this as a simple mobius story - it's more complex and thoughtful than that description implies, and at novella-length, richer than most longer works.$crowley proved his master-craftsmanship in little, big, a work that embodies its seed-idea with a grace and entirety few other authors have accomplished (barry lopez is the only one who comes to mind, able to communicate the most peculiar and ineffable feelings). i was looking forward to regaining the magic of crowley's works with this book, but i apparently flubbed it, because that didn't happen - i read the book at a magic: the gathering tournament in a jet-lagged exhaustion, so i probably didn't give it a fair shake. part of this is the problem with a book this length - unlike little, big, the world and characters don't have time to grow on you like they're supposed to.$some novels you try to avoid synopsis because the story is too joyful in its own unfolding. other novels lend themselves nicely to synopsis; and in some novels you wouldn't know where to start. there are a few authors, also, towards whom i have to disclose an underlying bias (i think harold bloom admitted as much in this case) - john crowley is one of these. in great work of time these two conditions intersect. crowley has been a favourite of mine since i first read little, big, which by the way if you have any interest in contemporary, adult fantasy that doesn't involve orcses and elves and dragons (not that there's anything wrong with that), you owe it to yourself to read: read the literary significance section on the novel in wikipedia and find stronger recommendations than mine."
how to make a journal of your life by dan price,"a tiny, inspirational book about keeping a diary including the art of writing, sketching, collage and photography. i especially enjoyed the chapter about photography since this is a topic rarely mentioned in books about journaling (at least to my knowledge). since this is only 100 pages and small format, most topics are only briefly touched upon, but it can whet your appetite to learn more about the techniques mentioned.$what a neat, little book on journaling. and not just journaling.but documenting life around you. first, write about whatever, but more importantly, add to the journal, with drawing, photos, snippets and pieces found around you. there is a small portion on taking good photos, how to sketch with the right side of your brain, and saving those little mementos from life and add them to your journal with a note. there is even a small piece on making your own journal to fill and how rewarding it is to go through them later to see and read about where you've been and what you've seen and experienced. $if you've ever thought of starting a journal but didn't know where to begin you have dan price to show you the way. his handwritten book on how to write, document, illustrate and doodle a journal is priceless. he makes it look easy and super fun! i suggest you get this book to help get you excited about journaling!$i have been wanting to start a journal for a very long time and it just always seemed daunting! dan made it seem so fun and made sure to let the reader know that there is no wrong way of doing it and to make it fun along the way! $i liked this book better the second time around and would give it four stars now. the author gives some good advice for journal-keeping and using drawings and photos and found objects to document your journey through life. the book is all hand-drawn and illustrated and the author was a bit of a nomad who has a zest for life all of which is motivating and contagious. and he lives in joseph, oregon which is a great place i spent a lot of summers in when i was a child. extra points for that."
immortals of meluha,"i first heard about this book from a friend who had said that the book was a good read. curious i tried reading up more about it and saw that noted columnists like anil dharkar and sandipan deb had given it great reviews. i read the first chapter online and liked it well enough that i decided to buy it. i went to quite a few book shops and found that it was sold out in most places. that is really surprising for a first time indian author. finally i found it in a tiny little shop, the proprietor telling me that the one i bought was one of the last copies he had left.$flat and ordinary writing. it is like reading an essay written by a child in school. i am a big fan of fantasy novels and especially those that are based on indian mythology and that's why i had picked up this book early 2010 itself. sadly, all my excitement died out after only the first chapter when i had figured out already what the quality of writing was. the one necessary element in any fantasy writing is strong profiles of the characters, especially the leading ones, since characters in fantasy stories are always larger than life. another crucial element in fantasy novels is the creation of a sense of grandeur of the environment, the civilizations and races and also the characters interactions with them. however, in this book, the author gets so engrossed in moving the story forward that he forgets to create an image of any of the characters or of the fantasy world they live in.$this book is a nightmare for all those who not only are devout lovers of shiva but worship him for what we know of him. for me it definitely was a nightmare. the idea of his journey from human to supreme being is the only thing about the plot that i liked and which had tempted me to buy this book. but, very sadly, i could not relate to the tripathi's take on tibetan shiva and to the very vague writing (which killed me)!! moreover, if you really want to read a good mythology, why not read shiva purana or saivism this book is not for you. but, if in case you just want a not so well-written indian fiction you could waste your time on this! i believe even fiction should have some essence to it. $ "
imperial earth,"unexpectedly romantic are the words that describe imperial earth. for many years i have known this novel only by its title. based on that title, i had assumed the novel would feel bold and grandiose in every respect. so i was not prepared for how unexpectedly intimate and introspective it is. $well this was pretty cool.descriptions of titan, of space travel, and of a depopulated and reforested earth are all great. i also like the idea of washington dc as a giant smithsonian. settings are all great as usual.the social/cultural observations which are thrown in are pretty neat too. for example (spoilers) the main character is black, but this is only revealed halfway through the book as an inconsequential detail. he is also bisexual, as are most people. religion and meat eating have also pretty much died out. also large concentrations of wealth no longer exist.$it's been a while since i picked up clarke, and somehow i missed this when i was younger. in a lot of ways, i am glad i waited, because there are some parts of this that would not have effected me the same way when i was younger.$i just re-read this after an interval of roughly 35 years. written to commemorate the us bicentennial in 1976, it's basically propaganda for space travel and technological innovation, aimed at young americans. it is set in a future where space travel within the solar system is common, colonies have been established on (at least) mercury, the moon, mars and titan, and the american political model, tempered by a degree of enlightened authoritarianism, has been extended throughout the solar stystem.$ i think sf author ben bova must have read this and had his socks knocked off; the flavour of “imperial earth” is all over his lovely grand tour novels, and you can see in arthur clarke's book the inspiration for bova's more recent epic series (and it's all win-win, as far as this sf fan is concerned). it's an odd title for a novel that is an exquisite exercise in peaceful world-building, but clarke creates a living, breathing future you can reach out and touch. mind you, some of the dreamy tropical reef exploration feels a bit out of synch with the rest of the book, but it's a mild tangent that doesn't detract from the rest of this sumptuous novel. "
journal to the self,"it was ok. the journaling ideas were fantastic. however, many of the stories and examples were extremely new-agey. if you are willing to call your journal your “blood brother” or sprit friend or whatever, then you will love this. if you are more plain & practical like me, you'll appreciate the tips while gritting your teeth at the fuzziness.$what i learned from this book is that there are no rules when it comes to personal journal writing. this one aspect has made the idea of keeping my own journal less daunting.$a simple text, but i think a classic. when i give journal workshops at my local library, this is the main text i use to gather up potential exercises (and they're all fun!) i have also had kathleen adams as a teacher in grad school and she's a beautiful human being. it was perhaps one of the most fulfilling cycles in my life when i was consistently working with her coursework, which included the workbook version of this text.$i bought and read this book with so much pleasure i made it a part of my permanent library. it is still there, on my shelf, and i refer to it often. if i had to chooe between this or her other book the way of the journal i would say read this one! however, don't hesitate to buy both because they are a perfect complement to one another. invaluable to anyone who takes their journaling seriously or who maybe needs to infuse their journaling with something new. $as someone with an ever-growing interest in and love for journaling, i really liked this book. i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to further their connections with themselves or even just gain a new perspective on journaling and to see what it can do for a person. $"
keeping a journal you love by sheila bender,"this is a book aimed toward journalers who also want to write, although the book description doesn't make that clear. bender quotes from the journals of published writers (fiction and non-fiction) and lets those excerpts inspire writing and journaling exercises for the reader to try. this isn't a book for people who have never journaled before, yet it doesn't really offer much to the experienced journaler either. perhaps advanced beginners would get the most out of this book, plus its target audience: people who want to write, period.$as my children grew from preschoolers to high schoolers, entries to my childhood diary increased while my responses to writing prompts became more and more sporadic; those one-line prompts didn't always strike the right chord to get my creative juices flowing. i started to rethink “journaling” and how i spent my writing time, and turned to these books for guidance.$this book had some helpful tips and interesting parts, but it seemed confused. i couldn't tell if it was written as a creative writing books, as in “journaling your way to becoming a better fiction writer” or as a book about getting your life down on paper. i thought it would be the latter. it mostly tried to be both, but fell short with each topic. also, the journal excerpts as examples got old and most of the tips were rather shallow. it's a fine book and a fun enough read, but not one i will return to for reference. $there are a lot of great suggestions in this book, and many of the exercises are quite fun. nothing is particularly revolutionary, but if you do want to start a journal you can keep up with, bender gives important writing reminders and interesting ways to keep coming up with new material.$i liked this book alright i am just not sure this approach to journaling works for me. while there were some suggestions that interested me most of it is based off of ideas from others journal writings and while there's nothing wrong with that in and of itself, it can make it harder to let your own voice come through in your writing.$"
midnight's children,"midnight's children is not at all a fast read; it actually walks the line of being unpleasantly the opposite. the prose is dense and initially frustrating in a way that seems almost deliberate, with repeated instances of the narrator rambling ahead to a point that he feels is important--but then, before revealing anything of importance, deciding that things ought to come in their proper order. this use of digressions (or, better put, quarter-digressions) can either be attributed to a charmingly distractable narrator or a vehicle for (perhaps cheaply) tantalizing the reader... or both.$this is my absolute favourite rushdie novel. its background of the partition of india and pakistan after the disastrous and cowardly retreat of the british occupiers and the ensuing emergency under indira ghandi provides a breathtaking tableau for rushdie's narrative. his narrator is completely unreliable and that is what makes the story so fascinating. i lend this book out so many times after talking about it so much (and never got my paperback copy returned) that i had to buy a hardcover that i would no longer lend out so as not to lose it anymore. it was the first time i read a book with this kind of narration (mostly having had the omniscient, distant 3rd party narrator or the interior dialog or stream-of-consciousness 1st person narrator) and this was a revelation for me which later led me to read dfw, pynchon and other post-modern writers with relish. a fantastic 20th c masterpiece!$discard skepticism as you approach this epic. suspend disbelief. because myth and truth blend into each other imperfectly to spin a gossamer-fine web of reality on which the nation state is balanced precariously. and we, the legatees of this yarn, are caught up in a surrealist farce which plays out interminably in this land of heat and dust and many smells, our rational selves perennially clashing with our shallow beliefs but eventually succumbing to an incomprehensible love of the absurd. illusion has more to offer than you think.$the narrator, the indian muslim saleem sinai, doesn’t claim to possess the absolute truth of the events that shape the world he lives in, he doesn’t even claim to understand them and so he teases but never poses, he plays with his imagination but never lies about his erratic memory which, either real, inaccurate or both, ends up participating as another fictional character in the story."
narrative journaling,"i am a middle-age american white guy obsessed with my country's shameful chapter, our peculiar institution - slavery. no matter how many books i read, movies i see or any other means of approaching the subject there exists a gulf of understanding that can never be bridged. i can feel pity, shame, anger or any other emotion, but i will never know. $i am embarrassed to say i had no idea that this was a true story. i find it odd that i had never heard of this particular slave narrative, given how powerful and informative it is. i decided to read it after all the media frenzy surrounding the movie (which i havenot watched and probably will not).$i cannot fathom this book. everything that happens in this autobiography is so distant from anything that i have experienced that i cannot even conceive of the injustice in any sort of measurable or reasonable amount. i feel angry and heartbroken that this sort of crime ever took place in our country, disgusted to the point of choking, so horrified that human trafficking through america is still so present and strong, so helpless because i donot even know how to help, because i want to help, because i would want to kill the person that took my freedom from me and forced me to work, in any capacity, that treated me like chattel.$a lot of people are saying this book reads like a novel, but i couldn't disagree more. it reads like a man telling his life story, which is fascinating, giving what the man became for twelve years, but not as engrossing as some of the new journalism that came out in the 60s and 70s by people like hunter s. thompson and norman mailer. call it a book of its time. $the gut wrenching account, apparently true, of solomon northrup, a free black man, with wife and children living in new york state. he is kidnapped and sold as a slave, then shipped south to work on the plantations in bayou boeuf louisiana. he spends most of the twelve years under the cruel tyranny of a sadistic plantation owner named epps. $i can say that it was chilling, heart breaking, gut wrenching, atrocious and none of these words can aptly describe solomon northup's experience as told in this memoir. i did not know about this book until i saw the movie last month. during the brutal lashing scenes and the heart breaking scene of a mother separated from her children, you could hear a pin drop in the theater. $"
one million tomorrows,"i read this back in 1970 when it was first published. after reading a couple of scathing reviews below, i decided to reread it and see if i still like it. i am a big fan of bob shaw --- especially orbitsville and the ragged astronauts. so far this one is pretty good.$by the norms of the last years of the 22nd century will carewe is an unusual funkie - or functional male - in that he has turned forty, has been in a monogamous relationship for ten years to his wife athene, and has given no indication yet that he intends to tie off.$science has found a way to slow down the decay of the body, ensuring that humans have become, in theory, immortal. the only problem is, while females retain their sexual potency, males become effectively impotent as a result.$this is not a future that i would care for, to say the least. you can take a shot to become immortal but have all the lead taken out of your pencil if you are a man, so to speak. also, being immortal doesn't mean that you are invincible. you can still die from a satellite dhish falling off your dhome as you are walking out the dhoor.$ "
sacred games,"it took me a year to read this book. one year and exactly three days. at nine hundred pages, i spent 12 months considering how to approach the text, how to shrink it and put it in my pocket, my purse, comfortably under my arm. after 12 months i sat down, opened it, and proceeded to consume it in three days.$well, what a little hypocrite i am . because politically, this book has so much wrong with it on so many levels. so don't rush out and read it and then denounce me, and you know who i am talking to. but. still. what a story. what writing. what a great read. in its scope and thrust and breadth -- it is at once a detective story, a character study or rather series of character studies, a sweeping meditation on the post-colonial history of india and in particular the national question (i found one of the subplots, having to do with the ravages of the partition, just devastating, it left me weak and weeping), a fascinating portrait of a great city -- this is a masterful novel. tolstoyan, i'd say (now that i am such a big tolstoy expert having finally read war & peace recently). $what a book! it took me a while to complete owing to the length. but a solid story with many smaller stories intertwined. the main protagonists sartaj singh and ganesh gaitonde are very very well written. not that well covered but very memorable are the two sisters jojo and mary. but the smaller characters (present in abundance) are the true scene-stealers. aadil who appears at the fag end, sartaj's co-workers - kanetkar (and his family), kamble, parulkar, majid khan; blackmailed kamala and her boyfriend, guruji shukla, iffat biwi - these folks will live with me for a long while. the working of mumbai police and underworld have been covered really thoroughly. hats off for this much research.$"
shadow lines,"this was an amazing book that left me blown away by the beautiful vivid storytelling, the insightful analytical commentary and the thought provoking message of the book.the book collapses time and space, placing events from different times and places next to each other. the narrator goes from his experience as a little boy in india to london both through the stories of his uncle and his own experience there as a student. from this narrative structure emerges a powerful message.$i think this is the perfect book. it isn't a novel. it is something beyond what words can comprehend. our lives are made up of memories. maybe proper, maybe improper. this is a live example of that. the strange yet a unique and beautiful way of narration makes the story much more intriguing. it literally goes beyond time and space to build an exquisite stockpile of emotions. a person doesn't read this book, he feels it.$this book was recommended to me by a friend who had simply loved it. she claimed the book to be one that was meant to be read several times, with each reading rendering a deeper understanding and probably a different interpretation. i was naturally curious and wanted to see what she meant by that statement. with that in mind, i promised to read it with her and discuss it. of course, i was really lazy and never got around to reading it, until today$i'm having a hard time figuring out what to say about this. the description and some of the reviews say this is, on the surface, a story of two families - one indian, one english. i found it only the story of the indian family who happened to know the white english family and who occasionally spent time with one or other of them. by that i mean that the indian family sometimes interacted just with themselves, but the white family members interacted only with the indian family members, rather than sometimes just with each other.$i really wanted to like this book. there are some great observations from a child's point of view. there are also some real sentiments from the elderly grandmother teacher. but..i easily put this book down to watch tv, talk to my cat, tweeze my eye brows or anything else. the narrator /main character tells his story in a haphazard fashion, not stream of consciousness. either i couldn't follow him or i didn't care enough to try.i thought it would be nice to read about a middle class indian for a change. the narrator's family was intimately connected with an english middle class family . i didn't find them or their relationship engrossing either.the political upheaval , partition of pakistan, should have been a lightening rod. it was significant , but buried.$"
stranger in a strange land ,"apparently a classic of the sci-fi cannon, i'd never heard of this book until it came up on a book club here. it took me a long time to read only because of lack of time, and a rather annoying trait the author has that i will go into later.this is one of those books that tells us more about the period it was written in than anything else, so it's important to note that it was first published in 1961 and later again in 1968 - when moon fever was running high and people seemed to have high expectations for human achievement.$this is a book that it seems like i should like. it deals with issues of religion, including a strong critique of religion as we know it, presents socially progressive ideas about sex and relationships, and relies upon a fundamentally humanist, individualist philosophy.$he's right it is. a woman should shroud herself in black, even wear a veil over her eyes and for extra protection she should wear a big size of doc martin boots so it could be a man under the shroud (michael jackson used to do that) and always be accompanied when she goes out. which should be rarely. very rarely. when she is in the house (most of the time) she should have the view through windows obscured and a chain on the door. no man who is not related to her should enter. not workmen, not the police, not her son's friends from school. no one. then she won't be raped.$nowadays, most people seem to either love or hate heinlein. many read his children's books like podkayne from mars, red planet and the rolling stones, enjoyed the adventure and moved on to his adult stuff just to get more. the politics, sexism and lack of depth went over their young heads. to them, his books were just great adventure. and yes, for the era in which they were written, they were great adventure and less sexist than most sf at the time. $"
swami and friends,"i would never have known about narayan had not the parent of a child with whom i worked introduced me with a christmas present of the everyman's library edition of the four 'malgugi' novels. another lucky reward of my job. the first of these novels, 'swami' is the story of a ten-year-old boy in a small town in southern india, just as gandhi's independence movement is gaining traction. $this is a beautiful book about childhood, specifically boyhood, told by a master story teller about to begin his long and fruitful creative life.famously, swami and friends is the work which got rk narayan his start, when a friend in london showed the manuscript to graham greene, leading to its publication, after the friend ignored rkn’s instruction to throw the work into the thames.$in fact, i enjoyed reading all of the 19 chapters in the first narayan novel since i'd never read him before. it's one of the novels published in the everyman's library series and i couldn't help admiring him as well as his writing style, narrative and sense of humour to the extent that i could visualize how the rural indians lived in the remote country nearly similar to my rural thailand some 55 years ago.i'm sorry i don't have the everyman's library hardcover nearby, therefore, i can't write my review in more detail in the meantime (i'd definitely write a more in-depth one whenever i can find the copy). in short, find this novel to read and you'd love narayan as one of the pioneering indian writers in the 20th century."
tender is the night,"when fitzgerald finished this gem, he was stunned by the poor reviews it received. i honestly think it's a profoundly more true and powerful book than gatsby ever will be. his effortless and viceral writing tells a story of such complex and accurate human relationships, i often find myself reflecting on dick diver as a friend i should check up on, and part of me thinks i spent a year of my youth hanging out on the french riveria having too much to drink, but somehow pulling it off sophistication. now that i sound like a lunatic, i must express this is not normal for me. the world and characters really got under my skin. after my first reading i woke myself by weeping.and i was weeping for the characters. $how is one to feel about a protagonist who frequently displays signs of elitism, sexism, bigotry and homophobia, finds himself worryingly attracted to young girls, has no goal in life except to make himself useful to damsels in distress, and drinks away his career and marriage, ending up a mere shadow of his former self? is one supposed to regard him as a tragic hero? is one to sympathise with him? and if one does sympathise with him, is that because of the way he was written, or rather because we are aware that he is a thinly veiled version of the author himself, a giant of early-twentieth american literature?$this book is so pointless, you could read the chapters in random order and probably not feel like you'd missed much. this marks my second and final attempt to read it. i almost made it to the halfway point this time. if you loved the great gatsby, don't get your hopes up for this one to be anything close to that good. you'll be disappointed.$"
the aesthetic page,"i came to the decorated page as a text-centric journal-keeper who rarely added anything else, and that would be nothing much more than gluing in a comic strip, artifact or article relative to the content of an entry. i was leery of a book with this title: what mattered was the text, so why decorate extraneously for decoration sake? then i read what gwen diehn had to say (and show) and i immediately went out and bought a small inexpensive watercolor set, water color pencils and a pack of cheap brushes. diehn offers general how-to information about various techniques and tools and her book is richly illustrated with photographs of a variety of journals. this is a fine companion volume to the author's other book, the decorated journal. both are good for beginner or more advanced journal keepers and artists. $at anytime, i have 3 journals going. my goal is to chronicle not only events for future reference but create a beautiful and accurate history of what my life is like as i see it through my eyes and experiences. this is a good but pricey resource i would recommend, but only if you have a coupon or can get it used. i can say it's defiitely improved my journals.$in the decorated page — an inspiring and amply illustrated forerunner to her most recent work, the decorated journal — author and artist gwen diehn effortlessly motivates the flowing of creative juices with regards visual journaling (complementing descriptive text with visual art), beautifying and personalizing journals, scrapbooks, and albums as a form of artistic expression.$i have kept journals since i was a little girl (i can go back and read my first impressions on getting glasses, back when i was eight), and recently i have started making and selling notebooks. the decorated page has some great ideas for enhancing the notebooks i sell, and outlines many art techniques that fit well inside the pages of a book. i'd recommend it to other journal enthusiasts, or to aspiring writers and artists looking for ways to get unstuck and conquer those blank white expanses of empty pages.$an old (now) but still very good primer on journals and journaling. gwen diehn includes all the basics you'll need to know to start keeping your own journal: there's plenty of information on the materials needed, including what will make your work archival; tips on modifying a book and cover to suit your needs, as well as on preparing backgrounds; then suggestions on design and layout. diehn also takes the reader step by step through 10 sample pages tackling different issues with varied techniques.$"
the blue umbrella,"this is a children's fiction. it has a simple story about a girl name binny and her love of a blue silk umbrella which she spots and obtains it from some picnickers in exchange for a necklace which had a leopard's claw which was considered as good luck. the adults of the village are jealous of her. children adore and appreciate her umbrella and she gives it to them to hold. the story describes, how happy binny is with her umbrella which she never closes.$the book is about a young village girl, who is total love with her magnificent, beautiful, and ye-pleasing blue colored umbrella, and soon becomes the topic of discussion for the entire village. an old man, who cons children from their belongings gets fascinated with the blue umbrella, and is extremely jealous, from the fact that the young girl is getting all the attention, just because of that umbrella. sometimes, in life, how do small things effect us emotionally, and how things changes when those small little things are no longer a part of us, could be summarized as theme of the brilliant novella from the legendary writer.$few authors and books has the magic to transport you to childhood and the blue umbrella is one such book. i started it as a part of reading challenge and rereading the book reminds me of the days i enjoyed as a child.in less than 65 pages ruskin bond teaches us lessons of love, greed, sacrifice and how a kid can be happy with little things they have. the illustration by archana sreenivasan adds beauty to the book and captures the picturesque village, innocent biniya and grumpy ram.$ruskin bond is undoubtedly a name that emerges in our minds when we think about slow, subtle and mesmerizingly simple books to read on a lazy afternoon. ruskin bond makes sure to enthrall his readers by his beautiful descriptions of the nuances of the indian subcontinent, with a slow but very engaging storyline. the blue umbrella is not any different.set in a typical indian village, this novella tells a simple story of a village girl by the name binya, and her escapades with a pretty blue umbrella that she spots with some picnickers who happen to visit the village, and which she purchases from them in return for her necklace which has a tiger's claw strung to it. owing to the very simple life in the village, it so happens that all the villagers start wishing they had the umbrella. $"
the calcutta chromosome,"i think this is a book which has an excellent plot and the mystery is truly gripping. i particularly enjoyed the section where author phulboni experiences the apparition of lakhan and the station master at the ghost rail station of renupur. the narrative was so realistic and rich that i almost found myself in the shoes of phulboni. i think the computer tricks and overstated computing technology that is featured in this novel makes it slightly less credible, especially today when network computing and data transfer has become very advanced and an everyday regular affair.$my first ever book by a. ghosh and because of this i bought four of his later books over the years. none matched the suspense of the first one, which i read in the hot summer in a poorly air-conditioned texas dorm room. i could almost feel the delirium myself. $i'm finding it very difficult to give a genre label to this work - fantasy, horror, thriller, medical mystery historical fiction - though sci-fi for some reason seems to be its accepted genre. the plot uses a whole lot of themes - science, mysticism, religion, mythology, counter-science, even nihilism to a certain extent. i can't be sure but i also wonder if the author was firing a tiny salvo at a western attitude towards indian scholars, and how history has been written to glorify its authors. (non-objective and not giving credit where due) $if peter weir's movie the last wave (aka black rain) were set in india and involved the study of malaria, and you threw in a little stanislaw lem, and you stuck it all into a set of russian nesting dolls, you might end up with something like the calcutta chromosome. $excellent read. amitav ghosh's portrayl of kolkata is very refreshing and probably lends a good perspective to the various communities which have made kolkata its home during the colonial period.the story in itself is very thrilling and mysterious and keeps one guessing till the end ( unless you read the end first). it is a historical fiction but can be called a ghost story because of the cult which it describes. my take on this book is a four star. a good book to read to pass the time and know kolkata$"
the creative journal,"this book was my first introduction to creative journaling and therapeutic art. i loved it. now i am no longer in love with this book, but we're still good friends. it's unique among the newer explosion of creative journal books because of it's simplicity. the only materials required are paper and felt pens, and the examples from other people's journals use only these materials. i'd recommend it to people interested in using prompts to inspire self exploration in journal form.$this great book helped me find myself through writing with therapy and creativity. it helped removed write''s block which was a huge problem for me.$the first chapter of this book talks about how to use the book. it encourages you to read the whole book all the way through and then to go back and to follow the instructions in the book. that is what i have done with the book. so, far i have read it through and feel motivated, so i plan to now start going back and doing some of the writing prompts. for someone who has fallen out of journal writing and is trying to find the motivation in or back in i would suggest this book.$dowrick has a beautiful way with words. she is very inspiring and encouraging, and for someone who is either new to the journaling experience or someone who has not journaled in a while, i recommend this book. i actually recommend this book for writers, as well, because her writing style will motivate you and give you many ideas.$the room fills with a haze of myrrh, a thick saturday morning smoky scent that i dedicate to hel, my great goddess of death. with pen in hand and journal beneath it, i feel the freedom to begin my writing with purpose. i know not what purpose, yet, but i do feel freedom: the possibilities for journal writing are infinite, and setting the table with hel's power will lend something to whatever ends up written or unwritten."
the cricket on the hearth,"unfortunately, this was one of my least favorite dickens stories i've read to date. i wanted to read something by dickens for christmas to take a break from reading a christmas carol like i do each year at this time. i was disappointed to discover that, even though this story was in a volume called ""stories for christmas"" by dickens, it wasn't about christmas at all. it was basically about a couple families, simple and rustic, that redefine/renew their love for each other through a series of misunderstanding$i listened to this book in audio as well as reading it in print. i liked it. i didn't love it. i loved the narration by jim dale. he really made the characters come to life, but i had to actually read the printed story to understand parts of it. $while i enjoyed this book, i found it more difficult to follow than a christmas carol. it's a pleasant story with good characterization, and i liked the ending. the audio version was wonderfully narrated.$i hesitate to express my feelings on this one. i found the read to be tedious and dull, and yet ... the story was rather beautiful. you really have to break this one down in order to fully absorb it and appreciate it to its full extent.$this book is one of the more enjoyable christmas books by charles dickens. though it is not as complete a novel a 'a christmas carol' is or as thoughtful as 'the chimes' it is full of some warm and funny scenes and has lovable characters with the typical dickensian quirks meandering their way through a tale of misunderstandings, strangers with hidden secrets and the warmth of the victorian hearth that dickens captured so well."
the daffodil sky,"bates more successful than in his novels) there is once again the often exquisite prose, the always expert command of narrative intention which lend an importance to these intervals in the lives of the many people who cross the pages here. and again too the stir of the seasons, the soft countryside which is forever england to mr. bates has a more than occasional imprint. $the daffodil sky and other stories, which first appeared in harback in october 1955, and arrived in paperback in 1959, is a fine collection of 15 short stories, written between 1952 and 1955 and ranging from portraits of the english in foreign lands to poetic treatments of rural life that amply display his mature command of structure, atmosphere, and characterization and his compassionate view of the human condition. $"
the dragon masters,"i enjoyed this third entry in the dragon series. this series is interesting because it has such a different setting and culture - chinatown in san fransisco, so we see a lot of chinese-americans. i think the dragon shapeshifters are pretty cool, i like their different personalities. this isn't my absolute favorite paranormal series but it is a good one that is fun to read.$this series got better with each installment. i really got in to seth and carol's story. both very likeable characters. felt for carol cause she had no idea what she was and the extent of her powers. nicely done allyson. and what wasn't to love about seth. go ahead pick up this series, i am sure you'll enjoy it. $when seth is summoned by an imprisoned dragon master to do his bidding, practical and non-believer carol juan's own dragon master powers are unlocked and seth is called to her instead. higher powers have brought seth and carol together to prevent the unleashing of an ancient evil power onto the world. they don't always see eye to eye but there's definitely something more and powerful between them and they know they have to band together in order to succeed in saving the world and the people they love.$i will be honest, this book didn't really thrill me as much as the first two in the series. i just couldn't connect with carol or seth. the fact that for two novels carol was a disbeliever of magic and dragons made it hard to believe that all of a sudden she was this powerful dragon master who wielded more magic than even the silver dragon. the silver dragon, if i may add, we know from previous books is pretty damn strong.$"
the eye of the heron,"this was just a tiny little novel, but just packed with stuff i love. individual characters, compelling and interesting, but also embodying different political dogmas, the plot itself so packed with inherent symbolism that it shouldn't have been so light and natural. all coming together in a clean fast believable push through another world with the goal of freedom. it was beautiful.$ursula le guin's the eye of the heron looks like an easy, short book. my copy is quite slim, the writing is a reasonable size, and the prose is as polished as hers always is, and it's easy to read. there are some absolutely amazing quotes, that i loved to read just for the perspective she always brings to the discussion. these are the ones that struck me the most (in parts of them, description has been taken out to make them more universal).$another insightful novella, packed with politics, human rights, gender and class discrimination, philosophy and very sensorial descriptions.quite a good and quick read.$the people of the city arrived on the planet victoria by one-way spaceship, exiled from earth, convicted criminals. many years later the people of the peace arrive in the last such spaceship, also exiled, but by choice. they form a town and call it shantih, but the people of the city call it shanty - deftly contrasting the views of the city folk and the townfolk. over time the people of the peace have become the peasants of a feudal society in microcosm but now confrontation is coming. the people of the peace apply their principles of nonviolent non-co-operation. where will the confrontation lead the colonists of victoria to?$"
the female man,"this book is a complex and fascinating examination of gender roles and ideology. in it, russ contrasts and intertwines the stories of joanna (a 1970s feminist of a world much like, if not identical to, our own), jeannine (a young, fairly stereotypical woman of an alternate timeline in which the depression never ended), and janet (a woman from the distant utopian future of whileaway, a world with no men and only women), showing multiple variations on the issue or problem of sex difference alongside multiple responses to inequalities.$one of the best books i have ever read. uncomfortable, frenetic, literary, and goddamned magnificent.$feminism has evolved and changed over the decades and this book was written during the second wave of feminism (often referred to as women's lib) during the 1960s-1970s. i know that it is difficult for young women born in the 1980s and later to believe some of these things, but there was a time when your career options as a woman were very limited—you could be a nurse, teacher, secretary, or a housewife.$this book is an angry book. it's story of four women from very, very different lives. each woman's name starts with the letter j but they don't know each other until the story begins. as the book explores the lives of these women it's fractured, broken up and disjointed. it's not an easy story but the themes of the book are evident throughout.$this book has been on my radar for many years. for a long time i had borrowed it from my brother, but never got around to reading it. i finally returned his copy to him since i picked up an anthology that included this book. and now i have finally gotten around to reading it with another group on goodreads, and i am really glad we chose it for this month's fiction read.$"
the great indian novel,"i had actually give this book 4.5 stars or 9 out of 10. i only give 5's to books i am certain i will want to read again. while this is an excellent read, it does require an investment of time so i probably won't be able to revisit it..anyway, it sat on my tbr shelf for nearly 20 years and i am so glad i held on to it!$very funny, very clever, scathing and intricate, this irreverent mash-up of the mahabharata with the indian independence movement may not be the great indian novel, but it's certainly a great indian novel.$this is one interesting book that is worth commenting upon. for starters, it is one of the better novels to come from india. i am not sure if the author was in india when he wrote it, but regardless, he is an indian politician now, and that makes him as indian as morarji desai or lalu prasad yadav.$the most witty and entertaining book i have read this year. it's smartly written, the satire is spot-on, and the feeling at the end of the novel is not unlike that of getting up from a highly satisfying sadya (feast).$fantastic. with my limited understanding of early politics of independent india, i am not sure how much of this is fabricated. but, from what i do know, this novel read more like a history lesson our gandhi-nehru department of education never sanctioned. it took me a while to get through because i compulsively checked the real characters, but what a great use of my time!$"
the guide,"narayan's the guide is a good story about a man who is a tourist guide who does his absolute best to please his customers honestly or dishonestly, as is the nature of tourist guides everywhere. but he is brought low by romance and becomes a bit of a rogue. i don't want to spoil the story by writing out the plot but eventually, from the absolute depths a man can sink to, he rises on the back of being thought a holy man. his innate moral sense overrides his desire for an easier life and he risks all by telling it how it is.$"
the house of mirth,"i have read almost all of edith wharton's writing. i have the highest regard for her work. she was overshadowed by fitzgerald and hemingway in her day but even so she won the pulitzer prize in 1921 for her novel the age of innocence. the house of mirth was one of her early novels and my favorite, although i like all of her novels.$this book reminded me of when i used to tutor a particular 15-year-old boy. i'd arrive and he'd be snacking and watching this dreadful mtv reality show called my super sweet sixteen. i used to spend a lot of time over there, so i caught enough bits and pieces of it to feel thoroughly revolted.$this book has inspired my next tattoo. that is some fine literature. (and i am sure that if edith wharton were alive today, she would appreciate the tribute.)$i recently finished your book, the house of mirth and am once again left disappointed. i so very much want to love your books. your style of writing is beautiful and real, but the characters, oh the characters! i feel like i get to know them so well, and feel such hope for them, only to be crushed down at the end!$"
the hungry tide,"if shadow lines enthralled you, amitav ghosh's latest masterpiece, the hungry tide, will sweep you off your feet, and into the precarious waters of the sundarbans.in the typical ghosh style, the narrative moves fluidly between past and present. you will be transported into the mindset of the superstitious yet brave folk, who have adapted themselves to the constant ebb and flow of the tide and are living in continuous fear of the bengal tigers. the tide begins to turn with the advent of two seekers from the outside world - piyali roy, an indian-american marine biologist in search of the irrawaddy dolphins and kanai dutt, an urbane translator from new delhi who's there to retrieve his deceased uncle nirmal's journal.$i know amitav ghosh isn't for everyone, but i just adore his writing. i can't think of another author who can transport me to another place the way he does - whether it's india, somewhere else in asia, the us or the uk. i haven't yet visited the sundarbans, but after reading the hungry tide i feel like i've squelched my toes in the mud and scratched my skin on the mangrove roots of that region.$this book was written well before sea of poppies. it was a fairly interesting story set in an area of eastern india in a ""labyrinth of tiny islands known as the sundarbans, where settlers live in fear of drowning tides and man-eating tigers.""it was almost more of a documentary giving interesting facts about the history of the settlers, how the government fought them using this ground, how they eked out a living there and were sometimes eaten by tigers. dang tigers! $i have mixed feelings about ""the hungry tide."" amitav ghosh tells a large story firmly set in a particular place--the mangrove-covered islands in the estuary of the ganges river. the story has everything: love, class-difference, political conflict, natural and man-made catastrophes, and, of course, dolphins, tigers, and crocodiles (dangerous encounters with the latter two, friendly encounters with the first). and that's the problem."
the immortals,"the doorbell rang the other day and when i answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. he started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.$its actually two stories, the story of the hela cells and the story of the lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. the contrast between the poor lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. $i have moved this book on and off my tbr for years. the truth is that, with few exceptions, i am generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. i am a fan of fictional stories, and i think i have always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. especially a book about science, cells and medicine when i am more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.$when i was a graduate student in the field of ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. a good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. a really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue.$this could have been an incredible book. henrietta lacks story is finally told--and skloot makes very clear how important lacks cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from henrietta without her consent. $"
the inheritance of loss ,"the inheritance of loss by kiran desai is a magnificent, impressive novel that ultimately is disappointing. as a process, the book is almost stunningly good. as a product, it falls short.$while the writing was lovely and the theme of the conflicting indian identities in post-colonial india and in the united states was really interesting and supported with well-developed characters. but.i just couldn't get into it and found it like pulling teeth to get through. $there is a tendency to assume that anything that has won the booker prize must be problematic, however i found this winner to actually pretty good. the novel moves points of view and location regularly. it shifts between the foothills of the himalayas near kalimpong (set in 1986 with the gorkhaland movement as a backdrop) and new york and periodically goes back to the pre-war colonial period. the main characters centre on the household of jemubhai a retired judge, sai (his granddaughter), the cook, mutt the dog and gyan (sai's tutor who visits periodically). in new york is biju, the cook's son who is scraping a living working illegally in new york restaurants. $i am very interested in reading books on india since i read yann martel's life of pi. this novel gave me an idea about life of indians (although i already studied it in our high school history. ) i became more interested when i read a white tiger by aravind adiga from which i learned the real face of social system in india, that people in the lower class get through miserable and sordid life. this fact opened my mind then.$"
the journal book,"boring, dull, lifeless, and flat. this is so drawn out and boring i kept having to remind myself what the plot was.best to get someone else to sum up the story rather than undergo the torture of reading it.$even though i should expect some blowback, i still get a little defensive. i mean, no one wants to be called a horrendous person just because he or she didn't like an overlong, self-indulgent, self-important epic about a douche-y peg leg and a stupid whale.$i see more in this book each time i read it. class distinctions, friendships, character development, sin, repentance, forgiveness, redemption--all are explored and charted in this thirteenth novel of dickens.$it's the book that turned me off of dickens. i still shudder when i think of being forced to read it in high school. the descriptions just go on forever.make it stop!$to me great expectations was like an iceberg in that i knew, through some osmosis effect of years of cultural references, the plot of the first 20% of this book. it's been referenced and rehashed so many times that miss havisham can be visualised by most people and they all know her as a crazy old lady in a wedding dress who owns a big house.$"
the lost planet ,"a little while ago my eleven year old sister needed a book for a school project, so we went to barnes and noble to find one. it took us two hours of picking out books and reading the first chapters to find the one she really liked. the lost planet first caught my eye because the cover art is so amazingly stunning.$ i wanted to read the lost planet as soon as i saw that cover many months ago. and i liked the summary as well. then i was lucky to get an arc from macmillan months ago, but i never found the time to start reading it. but today i really wanted to. and i am so glad i did. because i really enjoyed this book.$this was a science fiction adventure written for the young reader. there was mystery, rocket ships, scary monsters, weird aliens and a boy with special powers and no memory. what to to do? who to trust? an exciting trip though the galaxy $it's a lot to keep up with - the races, planets, politics, character stories - but it was a good read. i like that it compels me to read the next book but at the same time it feels like it can stand alone. $"
the new diary,"it is one long anecdote disguised as a novel. a lot like devil wears prada, it is just a laundry list of incidents while working for the shallow, designer-clad perfectionist. it reads more like an article in us weekly, in touch, and or the mecca of all celebrity rag mag's, people.$this book was a gift while i was working as a nanny. at first it was funny, with all of the little observations that all nannies make- mainly about a certain, small subsection of women who hire nannies- the wealthy, entitled, narcissistic bitches. $i read this during a series of fifteen-minute breaks at my job. in the interest of full disclosure, i have a bit of a grudge against any book packaged as chick-lit, the literary equivalent of low-cal fast food. however, i thoroughly enjoyed both the girls guide to hunting and fishing and prep, and understand that genuinely good fiction is sometimes whored out with candy-colored covers so they'll sell, and i am always happy to be taken by surprise when that's the case.$i read this book back when i was in college. this was actually the very first non-middle grade english book i ever bought! i had only bought some of meg cabot's princess diaries before then. but that was about it and none of that felt as grown up to me as the nanny diaries. hmm, i just realized they were both diaries, huh? and to think i have never been one to keep any sort whatsoever! anywho.$"
the palace of illusions,"i was intrigued as soon as i heard the plot of the palace of illusions, and i knew i was going to like it right away. i think chitra banerjee divakaruni deserves three out of the five stars i gave her just for thinking of the idea itself. the mahabharata has been part of india's ancient culture and history for the past 3000 years, and yet no one ever thought of narrating the epic from a different point of view.$palace of illusions by chitra banerjee divakaruni had been on my tbr list for years, but honestly, i wasn't sure it was for me. as i review it today, i have only myself to blame. i was totally swept over by chitra's prose, mesmerized by the conviction with which she writes the story of one of the most complex characters of mahabharata, that too, in first person. kudos to the author for successfully presenting a fast paced compendium of this epic indian text, which as it happens, is also one of the longest poems ever written (it is roughly ten times the length of the iliad and the odyssey combined, as per wikipedia).$pertama, cover yang menarik. yup, terkadang mata saya suka sekali dengan keindahan cover suatu buku. perpaduan warnanya seperti membawa saya ke istana khayalan. cover aselinya juga keren..i love green $"
the private life of the diary,"a little too much all over the place for me - i think i get the tradition bayley is writing in (mixing memoir and criticism) but i am not sure it was entirely working here. i also found it oddly judgmental in places. the first two chapters are really good, though.$a really lovely book. easy to read, well structured and whilst slightly whimsical there is enough there to keep you interested and reaching for the next page$what a good read. lots to think about later and so many interesting stories in it. i loved this book $i enjoyed reading this but it was not what i expected. i think i was expecting something a little more analytical whereas this is a very flowing and descriptive account (which consequently means it's very easy to read and does make for enjoyable reading!).$"
the secret of the nagas,"i feel like i just finished reading one of the star wars installments. with shiva as anakin, sati as padme, unexplored regions with strange inhabitants with secrets and continuous travels. the book was just too formulaic. that is not to say that it is not a good read - it is just that i was expecting the second book to be better than the first in some ways at least, and quite frankly, it is not.$i still maintain that this book is a great concept. taking an indian god like shiva with multiple facets to his persona and coming up with such an elaborate tale takes a different kind of imagination. having grown up hearing stories about gods like shiva, vishnu, rama, krishna etc curiosity was the one thing that drew me towards the first book in the series.$the second novel in amish's shiva trilogy series and it steals the show by revealing the most shocking yet pleasant tight-lipped remains of the immortals of meluha$finally the book is out. for past one year we (and here i can talk about four of us) have been waiting for the release of this book. checking every month and then on a weekly basis. its one of the firsts in mythological fiction in india based on god shiva.$"
the void captain's tale,"although the book contains much quotable and interesting material, it ultimately fails in a way almost uniquely reserved for science fiction: the artificiality of its construction leaves it bereft of humanity. the book blends japanese, french, spanish, and german phrases into the english of its projected future; this conceit is never as interesting in practice as in idea, and wears heavily on the reader only one quarter into the text. $this may have been the most difficult book i have read all year. using its literary aspirations and eccentric mix of languages to support a slow-moving - though compelling - plot, spinrad has crafted one of the most interesting books i have read all year. $i have talked before about sf authors setting their sights a little too high, and some of the novels nominated for the hugo or nebula getting by more on concept than actual delivery. in my review of dark universe i talk a little about samuel delany's opinion on story and writing and why i think he's wrong to say a novel's delivery cannot be exceeded by it's concept. i might be putting words into delany's mouth (i had trouble finding the actual quote), but either way void is a good example of the concept, no possible story could live up to the originality of the idea.$the language in this book, told in first person by the captain of the dragon zephyr is meant to evoke a merged, semi-polyglot future; captain genro intersperses both his tale and the dialogue of the people in it with various words and phrases from german, french, spanish, and other languages.$as someone who researches consciousness studies a a part of my career, i found the authors capacity to creatively articulate vastly complex philosophy while effectively weaving it into a science fiction narrative was brilliant. the style of writing was extremely colourful and really accentuated a sense of immersion into the world he was creating.$"
the waste land,"i am trying to write a term paper on this poem (key word is trying) and then i realized, hey, i should waste some time by writing a review of the poem on goodreads! so here we are. $i read a lot of poems as an english major back in the day. not many have stuck with me over the years, but the waste land is one of them: t.s. eliot's lamentation of the spiritual drought in our day, the waste land of our western society, lightened by a few fleeting glimpses of hope. it's fragmented, haunting, laden with symbolism and allusions, and utterly brilliant. $i often return here, and each time i find a different place and yet it is the same, maybe because i have heard and reheard the four quartets mantra. four quartets offer the solution because the waste land sets the problem.$this is the hardest poem i have ever read. certainly, the difficulty experienced when reading something is not enough reason to leave a bad review. i am currently reading ulysses, a notoriously difficult book, but i am enjoying it nonetheless. this, however, is an entirely different creature.$"
the white tiger ,"the perfect companion piece to slumdog millionaire, and if you didn't like that movie, you won't like this book for the same reasons. it's a no-nonsense bulldozing mordant splenetic jackhammer of a story written as a tough slangy 300 page fast-reading monologue. it's a novel of information, not art. it tells you all about modern india with a traditional rags-to-riches fable. our hero murders his employer unapologetically, and that's how he gets his riches.$to begin with, let me tell you first, of my association with this novel. i had never finished any contemporary novel, to put it bluntly, who cares!..was my attitude towards the contemporary writers, by the time i had bought this novel.$i have just this minute finished this book and i can already tell that it will be one of those books that i will think about often. it's not a book whose plot i can easily explain, or a book that i can easily fit into a particular genre on my shelves, but my god did it pack a powerful punch. i have hardly been able to put it down between sittings.$best contemporary novel i have read this year. antidote for the pastel lyricism of most mainstream novels coming out of india and a wonderful social satire with savage bit. kind of like terry southern's best work if he hadn't been all weeded up and goofy. $i have read this book while it was still unpublished manuscript and fell in love immediately. because it gave me the same pleasure as vikas swarup's q&a.$"
the wives of bath,"parts i loved, parts hard to read. i also love this movie, even though i personally found them very different from each other. but as with most, the book is better. it's all about the power of the imagination, and i will always love that $this was weird, and i really liked the writing. but as unique and enjoyable as the writing was, i felt very removed reading it, despite how poetic it was. so i got into it, but i didn't really get into it, and i was disappointed.$this is a book that i waited way too long to track down and read. i enjoyed the 2001 film lost and delirious, which was the only way i would have ever even heard of this book. since it's out of print, i filed it somewhere in the back of my mind to search for eventually. when i recently fell in love with chaucer's the canterbury tales,especially that hilarious wife of bath, i instantly remembered this book and decided it was time to buy an overpriced used copy online. $ having seen (and liked) the movie lost and delirious a few years back, i thought undoubtedly the source novel would help flesh out the characters. the movie itself deals with common lgbt themes such as societal norms and keeping up appearances both of which are painfully real and easily relatable.$the main problem that i found with this book was that i couldn't find enough time to read it. i actually missed my stop while reading it on the bus and actually considered staying on the route until the bus turned around and came back the other way - that's how much i enjoyed this book. i had seen the movie, lost and delirious, that was based on this book some time ago and was not particularly overwhelmed by the movie.$"
to a god unknown,"i opened this book for the first time - one of the few steinbeck novels i had not yet read - shortly after completing my own first attempt at writing a novel. the little book is one of steinbeck's earliest published works and, interestingly enough, the one that took him the longest to complete.$although it runs only 240 pages (compare that to east of eden at 601 pages), to a god unknown was the project which took steinbeck the longest to complete. it was only his second full-length novel, and he worked on it over a period of five years, nearly scrapping it on more than one occasion. and despite all of his revisions and efforts he just did not succeed in making it a great piece of literature.$i can always count on a steinbeck to break the streak of crappy, 2-star reads. i love how i can always return to him, with a book i have never really heard of, and immediately fall back in step with his style, his worldview, and completely love his message. $this book was steinbeck's third book in a long career. all of the wonderful elements of a steinbeck book are already there: the prose, the tension between characters and inside each character, the love of the land.$to a god unknown is a journey through metaphysics with john steinbeck as your tour guide. a relatively simple story that is a metaphor for one man's trip to, and through, self-awareness and universal connections. i would read a bit each day while my students were on their independent work. $"
to your scattered bodies go,"about as inventive as a great science fiction novel from a very good writer can be, this describes a world where everyone who ever lived is reincarnated into a river valley environment. filled with philosophical and theological metaphor, this is an excellent vehicle for the author to explore various subjects revolving around sociology, human nature and group dynamics. $a very kilgore troutish book. farmer comes up with a phenomenal idea: a world where every human being who's ever lived has been resurrected, to spend the rest of eternity coming to terms with each other along the banks of a gigantic river. unfortunately, after a few chapters it becomes clear that the author has no real plan about where to go with his concept. i remember some reviewer expressing similar disappointment with the matrix.$after he died, the famous 19th century explorer sir richard francis burton wasn't surprised to find that what the christian priests had taught about the resurrection wasn't true. but he was totally bewildered by what actually happened. he woke up young, hairless, naked, and turning in midair (as if on a spit) in the middle of 37 billion other young, hairless, naked and rotating humans.$i can't even with this book. the premise is moderately interesting, but the sexism is just too much. prudes and whores and nags and every fucking stereotype of woman you can think of, but god forbid there be a woman who serves any purpose other than sex object or victim. yet another genius who can imagine a world without religion or oppressive sexual mores, but can't imagine competent women with purpose and agency outside of a man.$"
train to pakistan,"this book, particularly this version with photographs from margaret bourke-white (a pioneer in photojournalism) was fantastic. it is short but a powerful story about the partition of india in 1947—an event i am sorry to say i had not known much about until coming on this field study to india. i began it on my own train ride to pakistan.$it is interesting to read historical novels where history is written as fiction.here is a novel that tries to record a memorable phase of indian history through fictional route but the essence is hardly lost in the process.....we come to know a village at brink of sutlej that is littered with equal majority of sikhs and muslims living together since a long past ago.that is the time of partition, the summer of 1947. muslims leave india and their exodus to pakistan is not free from human sufferings.and so is the case with hindus and sikhs leaving pakistan.$one of the earliest english language novels to capture the horrors of the indian partition of 1947. since then it has achieved classic status in the history of subcontinental literature and for right reasons.as independence and with it partition took reality the punjabis become desperate to learn about their fate. the province of punjab (like bengal on the eastern borders) was to be cut in half between its muslim majority population and hindu-sikh majority populationv$train to pakistan is a book about the horrors of civil war and how a small peaceful village finally becomes a part of religious hate and communal violence. it depicts the myriads of human emotions which arise in troubled times and portrays how nothing is concrete. khushwant singh makes his point with this book that there is no categorical distinction of a person as good or bad and that even the best of relationships, which are built upon the virtues of comradeship and empathy, can be totally engulfed in troubled times by selfishness, intolerance, hypocrisy and falsehood. it also portrays that the test of ones character is only in tough times- via the contrast of the two lead characters of the novel.$inspite of volumes being written about life before, during and after the indo-pak partition, 'train to pakistan' clearly stands apart. how the brotherhood between two major communities of a small peaceful village transforms to hatred and loathe overnight under the existing scenario, is unbelievably surprising. murders, thefts, molestations, massacres, over just a short span of time are enough to send shivers down your spine.$"
under the green star,"under the green star is lin carter's homage to edgar rice burroughs and it's a quick, fun, exciting adventure with some terrific scenery. our hero (who's telling the story in first person) was crippled by polio when he was a child and, as an adult, he's confined to a wheelchair. $our nameless protagonist is a recluse, independently wealthy, but crippled. learning the eastern art of soulcasting, he projects his soul from his body and sets off to search the cosmos. on one of his first stops, however, he is compelled to enter the comatose body of a warrior, and quickly becomes the foremost protector of a beautiful alien queen.$a quirky little sci-fi adventure, told in the manner of edgar rice burroughs john carter of mars books. lin carter makes it clear he is writing an homage to burroughs books, though anyone who has also read those books will recognize burroughs' style and tropes immediately.$yes, it is indeed a second -rate john carter of mars story, but lin carter freely admits of his inspiration, referring to it in the 1972 afterword as  a love letter. the nice thing is, he was successful in it coming off as an homage, rather than a rip off, and therefore this is a very pleasant read, especially for vacation reading.$really enjoyed this book. as others have pointed out it is not  high literature and the writing feels dated at time but carters style is earnest and engaging. while i originally picked up the book to prepare for narrating the audiobook version i have to say it won me over and narrating it was one of my most enjoyable projects ever. $one of the best executed pieces of sword & planet fiction from that time period, written before lin got all bitter.$"
write for life,"i had no idea that block once traveled around giving self-help seminars for writers! this is the book that he wrote to repurpose those seminars for the do-it-yourselfer. if you are into self-help psychology you will probably get a lot out of this book. otherwise, not so much. block spends a lot of words in the book talking about the seminar. i guess that is to provide the feel of what it would be like if you were doing this process in the seminar.$one of the best and most interesting books about writing. this is not about writing, but about the writer's mind and how to straighten that out. very surprising!$wish i could have a seminar, but it isn't possible yet. this wasn't a bad substitute. i would recommend to others. $this book really inspired me to write through fear and limiting beliefs. i highly recommend it.$potentially helpful but in the way that everything you do in life is helpful in someway or another.$along with dean koontz's how to write bestselling fiction, this is one of the best writing books i have ever read.$"

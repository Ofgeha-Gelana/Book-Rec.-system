rise of the earth dragon,"this was such a fun book. i loved all the different types of dragons and worm was just adorable. reading it with my son was a ton of fun and he didn't want me to stop. while it is the start to a series, it does have its own story line and plot. it's just open enough at the end to let parents know there's more to the story (which i already ordered).$a great book to introduce young readers to chapter books. the level is around late second to third grade, and most kids will enjoy the story of rory, the newest dragon master. taken from his home in the onion fields, he is brought to the king's castle and given a dragon, worm. there are several other dragon masters there, and they have their own dragons; each of whom reflects one of the four elements of earth. $this was a super quick read, but covered just enough that you want to find out more. kind of similar to how to train your dragon, but i like this one better. all the kids in bookgroup liked it.$the storyline is very simple and easy to follow. there is some magic and wonder as drake discovers that he is supposed to bond with and train with a dragon. although there is an immediate problem that is solved in this book, it looks like this is just part of a much larger story."
absolution gap,"please don't start with this book as it's number three (sort of) in the series, and the book imho is perhaps not the best way to introduce yourself to mr.reynolds. ""absolution gap"" though being a marvelous addition to the series is not as outright amazing as it's predictors, though a book you will want to read if you read the others.$this is the fourth novel i've ready by alastair reynolds, and i have to admit that while it took me a bit of time to get into the writing, the effort is never wasted. the build-up is slow but very steady, and i can honestly say that the final explosions are quite good. there's always something else to look forward to, on the other hand, and i suppose my only wish would be to have a prolific amount of works to support each one.$impressive and interesting conclusion to the revelation space trilogy. at first i was a little disappointed by the low key ending, but after a couple of days i find this perfectly human ending, very appropriate and satisfying.$this is the weakest of the revelation space novels, which is a shame, because it is the last and it ends more with a whimper than a bang. there are two main flaws; one is that it doesn't really end the story of humanity's encounter with the inhibitors at all and that feels unsatisfactory. there is a clear need for a fourth book to wrap things up properly, but we aren't going to get it. "
acccelerando,"this book starts off with a headache inducing deluge of acronyms and technogadgetideas, some of which are well known realities now. it's something that might be familiar to readers of some other stross books, for instance the ones set in a near future scotland e.g. halting state. a geek-guru makes a living from freebies given by grateful companies he puts in touch with other grateful companies in order to realise whatever mad idea he's come up with next.$this book is fantastic hard scifi in the emergent post-human genre. from what i can gather, this book has done for post-humanism what neuromancer did for cyberpunk. it's a touch dry in some places and the characters are a bit clunky, but i feel charles is most interested in describing the ""singularity"" rather than telling a traditional story.$the first third of this book is a five star white knuckle fall off the cliff ever accerating drop into the singularity. it's fascinating, breathtaking, horrifying, belivable and plausible. you're never quite sure what's coming, and you never catch your breath, but you're never completely lost either."
between_planets,"one of my favorite juvenile heinlein novels. while in school on earth, don receives a message to immediately leave school to join his parents on mars where they are station to do some sort of research as a war is brewing between earth and the new ""republic of venus"". don's trip is interrupted due to a war declaration. $heinlein's story of a young adult finishing school on earth before heading home to mars, only to find himself stranded by a war between earth and venus, has always been a favorite. i'm writing this after reading it in 2014 with the kids, and surprisingly this is probably their least favorite of the heinlein that i've introduced them to.$i thought this book was really dumb. this is probably the book i disagree with my father most over. normally i let my opinion of a book settle before judging, & if i keep thinking of it years later then that's a great book. i only keep thinking of this book as ""that bad book my father liked for some reason""$this book has an interesting story and the action never stops. however, it was obviously written in the 1950s. it is really amazing that it has held up as well as it has.$this is one of heinlein's juvenile novels. that said, there's a couple of somewhat more adult portions, so i'd recommend that younger children shouldn't read it. at least not without having some an interesting discussion or two. but, since the main character is a older teenager, it's more aimed towards that age range."
by the light of the green star  ,"the first is endemic to the series: i'm having trouble imagining the treetop cities. they're described as being jewel boxes perched on the limbs of five mile high trees, but i can't wrap my head around how a city-sized structure would sit there given the assumed scale. this would be a minor concern except that carter periodically mentions the cities and sets events there, and i can't get a good picture in my head of what this actually looks like.$the green star books was lin carter's best series in my opinion. good action and, although there are a lot of similarities to erb's work, i thought carter achieved some pretty good originality here. this is number 3 in the series.$alright, i've read better books, but i've read far worse. i don't have the rest of the series, so there's no telling if reading them would change my views. honestly, it was an enjoyable story, but there were a few things that frankly irritated me. first was the reiterating of information multiple times in the same book. it became rather monotonous hearing exactly how they got a specific item or met a certain person several times in the same book. once is enough for me to grasp it and remember it. lin also seemed to have a hard time writing the female personality.$though the first half of this book dragged (the first half of the book should have been condensed down to a few chapters) by the end i was more involved with the characters than the last book and i can't help but want to read the next. $"
cemetery world,"i loved this. a woman historian, robots who'd lived 1000s of years, ghosts, and a post-apocalyptic earth that had been reborn. the book reminded me most of peter beagle's work. there was a gentleness to the characters and the setting that despite the context made it feel comforting. it had some definite science fiction tropes but played them out in a wonderfully unique and interesting way. i am definitely going to read everything else i can find by this author.$my gosh this book was pretty terrible. i went into it with an open mind having read nothing else by this author. the whole story is a disaster, so very poorly put together that the badness at one point changes to pure laughs. sadly it is not intended to be funny...$i thought this would be a book about a visit back to old earth, where the characters would comb through the detritus of the past. possibly they would meet an old robot or hologram... i expected it to be full of sf tropes. instead it's a silly pulp action sf novel. extremely boring and doesn't resemble simak at all. $rather disappointing - i was told simak is one of the best at sci-fi, and all i saw in this book was adventures. which is not bad to read, but nothing more. not to speak about the idiotic discussions of the characters which were supposed to be a bit more intelligent than that.$lightly disappointed with the ending, but on the while a ""ripping good yarn"". a lot of detail (too muc?), delivered via expository dialogue which helps keep the page count down, but can jar a bit.seems more a product of the sixties than the seventies, surprised it was published 73, seems older than that, somehow."
citizen_of_the_galaxy,"this is considered (by most anyway) to be one of heinlein's youth or teen books. however the subject matter and the story telling are on an adult level and i don't think any science fiction fan who tries this one will be disappointed. $this book was incredibly jarring. i felt like robert heinlein had a good idea...then he had another one...then he had another one. and since he liked all three of them, he decided ""what the hell!"" and combined them. the book features a boy named thorby. at the beginning of the book, he is sold as a slave to a beggar man. the beggar man (surprise) turns out to be more then he appears. he trains up thorby and turns him into a super smart and clever beggar.$i liked this book less and less, the more i listened to it (be warned: the narrator's accents are occasionally awful) and after i finished it, the more i thought and read about it. there is a dusting of libertarian thought, not a philosophy i personally find very attractive - an anthropologist with a hideous southern accent - remember, i was listening to this - spouts some libertarian thought about mid-way through that made me scratch my head. $this is my favourite of all heinlein's juveniles. there is an added bit of sophistication to this one. heinlein's juveniles are a cut above the rest (asimov, leinster, silverberg, norton and the many other scifi authors of the fifties gave this sub-genre a shot - the appeal, i suppose, is that if the book was successful, you'd get a hardcover edition into all the public school libraries...) as he never dumb down his story or narrative to his younger audience."
an evil cradling,"it is a rare occasion that you get to read a book that manages to surprise you from beginning to end. i didn’t expect anything out of it, but i still discovered i had a number of expectations, because i discovered them whilst i was reading something that seemed to contradict what i subconsciously thought. $it is a rare occasion that you get to read a book that manages to surprise you from beginning to end. i didn’t expect anything out of it, but i still discovered i had a number of expectations, because i discovered them whilst i was reading something that seemed to contradict what i subconsciously thought.$deeply powerful and evocative, a book that takes you into the soul of despair - unlike and to the extent that no other book i have read quite compares (or at present comes to mind) - while at the same time stands as a testimony to the indefatigable human spirit of the author, which hauls his mind countless times out of the mire, regenerating from within always a renewed sense of hope, rallying with courage enough to at times strike fear into his captors.$one of the most moving and perspective shifting books i have ever read. keenan's story of captivity and exposure to a very broken segment of human society is highly topical in this day and age. anyone who would seek to defend imprisonment without trial should read and consider this man's experiences.$absolutely astonishing. the human spirit is iron strong in this true life depiction of being held hostage in beirut for four pain-staking years. his tenacity & fierce refusal to submit to senseless torture was mind-blowing. so beautifully written, i found myself re-reading paragraphs for their sheer brilliance. his mind, clearly strengthened through the horror, was remarkable."
arms and the man,"this is one of my favorite plays. i had the good fortune to see a pretty well done production at university, so i already knew the plot and language of the play. this is a superb comedy, right up there with the importance of being earnest, among the best plays of the late victorian period. this period seems to be (at least to me) the era when dry british humor really came to dominate english comedy and mark it as a distinct and recognizable genre, and shaw's play definitely maes use of that kind$the plays have a special effect on the readers. we imagine them as plays while we read understanding the dialogues the feelings the expressions. it is as if we are acting all the acts and our heart goes along with the play.and i should assure everyone this play of gb shaw is a remarkable one, with adventure, beautiful turn of events and above all the sweetness of an english romance. i am not good in rating a play, but i can't give anything less than the best to this.$what a great play. while it makes fun of the military, the chocolate-cream soldier is one i would follow into battle. if you enjoy snooty people getting their due, and love winning out, enjoy. the satire is as pointed today as it was in the 1890s.$an excellent play by shaw! the fecundity of war and the hypocrisy and pretentiousness of society have been ridiculed by such a simple and clever plot. the swiss chocolate cream soldier, captain blanchly, is a most intriguing character, in my opinion one of the most memorable in modern theatre.$i really enjoyed this play and found it to be quite humorous. i want to call it a satire, but really it is the complete opposite. shaw portrays characters so realistically without exaggerating their flaws, yet his characterization and clever dialogue expose the fact that, as sergius puts it, ""life's a farce."" "
beyond the mexique bay,"the book starts with an amazing description of what life will be in the future. after that first chapter everything goes down hill, and i felt emotional pain for each extra page i had to go through. perfect for masochists, and if you are latino and really like racism and ""malinchism"" then this book is for you.$i loved this book. it started me on a binge of huxley which i still haven't finished. the book ambles from one central american country to the next in a very leisurely manner that suggests what travel must have been like then.$it's his travelogue of a trip he took to guatemala and mexico in the early 30s. his observations of the culture and people are occasionally interesting, but on the whole shockingly arrogant, condescending and patronizing. he repeatedly emphasizes the ugliness of the indians, their goods, and their buildings, often treating them as if they were sub-human. one of the most egregious passages: ""indian men are often handsome;$i made it less than one hundred pages into this before the racism, condescension and general disgust for mankind (especially those not fortunate enough to be born into an incredibly wealthy and influential aristocratic family) became too much for me. i was looking forward to when huxley made his way towards the part of guatemala that i was once fortunate enough to call home, but despair set in when he took time away from praising colonialism to mock women from guatemala city for not keeping up"
blue remembered earth,"i loved this optimistic feel to the whole book, a nice breath of fresh air from all the post-apocalyptic and dystopia (although i do like those genres) and it's a credit to the author that he had the insight to use this perspective to such great effect.$the novel is a typical sherlock holmes follow the not-so-obvious clues tale. in order to maintain reader interest, however there must be a hint that something very important lies at the end of the trail. this element is missing in blue remembered earth. the industrialist scions worry about a secret that might hurt the business. since the reader has neither emotional nor intellectual interest in the business, this means very little. the semi-outcasts feel that some interesting clue regarding mysterious aspects of the personal life of the matriarch might be found.$i do love mr. reynolds' voice as a writer, the undertones of melancholy, like someone that still spends hours looking into the night sky! and then how can you not appreciate his subtle humor when you get sentences like this: ""the zookeepers could be overwhelming until you built up sufficient exposure tolerance. sunday had passed that point years ago: the wilder excesses of their starry-eyed idealism now ghosted through her like a flux of neutrinos. ""$all of reynolds novels are magical mystery tours where plots and characters matter less than lushly-imagined scenery, deftly-mixed science fact and scientific speculation, and broad social/philosophical themes. in this book, reynolds sides with the techno-optimists who believe that humanity, with our collective backs up against the wall, will find ways to blunt the worst aspects of climate change, find new sources of clean energy, and boldly go where science fiction has repeatedly gone before$the book's biggest problem has to do with the narrative thread that ties it together, the search for granny's secret. unfortunately, the thread is actually a trail of breadcrumbs that granny painstakingly planted all around the solar system. it's one thing to acquaint readers with an unfamiliar world through the investigation of a crime (as in ""the prefect"" or ""house of suns""), and it's something else entirely to drag the reader through a chain of deliberately designed puzzles a la ""national treasure"". the former can feel organic, but the latter is always silly and artificial. that's ok in the ""indiana jones"" films, but not in a serious novel."
cabbages and kings,"this has got to be among the best reads describing the odd friendship between colonialism and business interests, staged on the backdrop of latin america, with the original banana republic of anchuria. i landed up reading this after i learnt that this is where the term banana republic originated from. a free copy on project gutenberg and i could not stop reading this book once i started.$this is by far my favorite short story collection by o. henry. the tales take place in the same locale, a fictitious banana republic of the american tropics. there is an over-arcing plot that runs through the stories, concerning the ruling potentate's abdication and sudden departure with the nation's treasury funds, creating a mystery that isn't solved until the final vignette. along the way, we meet an amusing cast of characters, each one with his own colorful background.$i love o. henry. he had a unique grammar and diction. this book is a chain a short stories that could just as easily be called a novel. but i think the contrivances at the end, which are meant to tie the thing together, rather undermine the charm of the book.$ i was somewhat disappointed because the volume was actually a collection of short stories with a common theme, that of political events in honduras seen from a ""gringo"" point of view. o. henry's style is lively, and one learns a lot about u.s. society of the fin de siecle.$o.henry at his worst set of short stories. i couldnt find a relation between the stories as there was supposed to be some relation somewhere as i had heard. only thing was stories drifted from one person to other with some small link, but totally there was no sense in any story. "
carrion comfort,"i like long books, and carrion comfort is very long. clocking in at 886 pages, it isn't the longest i have read, either. the tiny typeface may have shortened the page count, though. i would love to find out the word count of this book. i say all this not to criticize the book (as you can see, i rated it 5 stars) but to explain why it took forever to read it.$this book! *covers eyes* oh my god! i don't know how to feel about it. dan simmons is such a great writer and his imagination scares me, like really, really bad! the stuff in this book was crazy! i couldn't believe what i was reading. sometimes i didn't even want to know where this story was going. but despite the horrific plot, one thing that simmons does really well is character building and backstory.$i must say; after reading this book, i am completely disheveled in appearance and spent. this book wore me out to say the least. this was a thrill ride of the highest order, and creeped me out the entire time. i don't want to give away anything and provide spoilers; for fear that 'someone' may find this out and complete a mind-game on me.$i always hesitate to say a book is overlong. i read because i like knowing the deepest thoughts and motivations of the characters who populate my fiction. books are meant to be longer, more in-depth experiences. there are thousands of studies that have been done on chapter and novel length, but the truth of the matter is: a reader only notices page count when the writing and/or story sucks. $there is no doubt that simmons is a great storyteller, able to write in a variety of genres, most notably horror, historical, and science fiction, and all with a skill for creating incredibly human characters in realistic situations. his words flow very well and his pacing is to my liking. "
clouds of witness,"this isn't my favorite of the lord peter novels – but as i'm sure i've said somewhere, that's like being my least favorite chocolate or my least favorite beatle. and this does have some of my favorite peter-bunter scenes, and gave me the name for one of my blogs$i just love lord peter. very frivolous, but totally serious about his crime-solving! in a way, he's like columbo. (not fashion, obviously.) he is underestimated by his adversary because of the front he puts to the world, but when you come right down to it, they're doomed. in this story, we learn more about lord peter and his family when a murder comes to the heart of his aristocratic family. very fun what with adultery, card sharps, elopements and soviets!$this novel really gives you a look at peter and his family. there is not enough of the dowager duchess but it's fun getting to know his siblings. bunter is someone i want in my life. he runs peter's bath water, brings him breakfast in bed and pulls him out of quicksand.$this is the second book in the lord peter wimsey series, and much better than the first one. this novel casts light on wimsey's family relationships, as his elder brother, gerald, the duke of denver, is accused of murdering the fiancé of their sister, lady mary.peter tries to remain as lighthearted as ever while joining forces with his friend, inspector parker, to investigate the killing. but it's clear that, below the sparkling surface, he is worried about his family, determined to clear his brother and bewildered as to what secrets both gerald and mary are hiding. so already in this second book the character of one of the greatest golden age amateur detectives is starting to deepen."
a catskill eagle,"really liked the storyline, with spenser and hawk traveling outside boston to get done what they need to do to make things right.for raymond this novel spenser gets side-tracked with his morals which up to now have be steady and firm. he does what needs to be done though for the betterment of everyone, but there's a subtle change in him. $this is robert parker's masterpiece. it is easily the best of all the spenser novels (and many of them are very, very good).the characters are nuanced, there are many shades of grey, yet parker's wonderful wit is still there.this is the spenser novel that should have been made into a feature film.$yes, the book is good, but all the elements are here that will lead to the bad books to come: the absence of real plot, the reliance on action and hollywood action movie cliches as a substitute, and susan-susan-susan. all the time. "
cover her face,"was able to finish this book but couldn't really care how it ended up - not one redeeming character and very little development of the detective. i'm assuming this is because this is a series so why make me like the detective and want me to read more about him and his cases. . .don't focus on him but rather the boring, selfish other 'suspects' and 'victim'. to be fair i should read at least one more in the series to see if it gets better (based on other reviews it sounds like it gets better). however, reading another in this series is far down on my list.$i believe this was p. d. james's first detective novel, and it is an amazing piece of work for a debut. it reads like, and is, more of a novel rather than the simpler, sketchier, slightly dumbed-down style more common in the genre. yet there is nothing highbrow or deliberately precious about it.the characters are well developed. the various conflicts and motivations of the characters are interesting and well developed as well$i enjoyed this visit back to the first mystery series i ever picked up in my late teens. sometimes, it's a good thing that my memory is so poor, as this felt like a first-time read. i love the way james writes. she has a great sense of place, and is able to concisely communicate various people's states of mind amazingly well. she is also able to manage this equally well from a man's or a woman's point of view. $a nice introduction to inspector dalgleish. i found the first third of the book rather dull. all i wanted was a dead body. but it took forever to kill off sally. (not a spoiler as if says who died in the blurb on the back of the book). i didn't guess the killer which comes as no surprise as i never can tell whodunnit."
the cricket on the hearth,"unfortunately, this was one of my least favorite dickens stories i've read to date. i wanted to read something by dickens for christmas to take a break from reading a christmas carol like i do each year at this time. i was disappointed to discover that, even though this story was in a volume called ""stories for christmas"" by dickens, it wasn't about christmas at all. it was basically about a couple families, simple and rustic, that redefine/renew their love for each other through a series of misunderstanding$i listened to this book in audio as well as reading it in print. i liked it. i didn't love it. i loved the narration by jim dale. he really made the characters come to life, but i had to actually read the printed story to understand parts of it. $while i enjoyed this book, i found it more difficult to follow than a christmas carol. it's a pleasant story with good characterization, and i liked the ending. the audio version was wonderfully narrated.$i hesitate to express my feelings on this one. i found the read to be tedious and dull, and yet ... the story was rather beautiful. you really have to break this one down in order to fully absorb it and appreciate it to its full extent.$this book is one of the more enjoyable christmas books by charles dickens. though it is not as complete a novel a 'a christmas carol' is or as thoughtful as 'the chimes' it is full of some warm and funny scenes and has lovable characters with the typical dickensian quirks meandering their way through a tale of misunderstandings, strangers with hidden secrets and the warmth of the victorian hearth that dickens captured so well."
the daffodil sky,"bates more successful than in his novels) there is once again the often exquisite prose, the always expert command of narrative intention which lend an importance to these intervals in the lives of the many people who cross the pages here. and again too the stir of the seasons, the soft countryside which is forever england to mr. bates has a more than occasional imprint. $the daffodil sky and other stories, which first appeared in harback in october 1955, and arrived in paperback in 1959, is a fine collection of 15 short stories, written between 1952 and 1955 and ranging from portraits of the english in foreign lands to poetic treatments of rural life that amply display his mature command of structure, atmosphere, and characterization and his compassionate view of the human condition. $"
the calcutta chromosome,"i think this is a book which has an excellent plot and the mystery is truly gripping. i particularly enjoyed the section where author phulboni experiences the apparition of lakhan and the station master at the ghost rail station of renupur. the narrative was so realistic and rich that i almost found myself in the shoes of phulboni. i think the computer tricks and overstated computing technology that is featured in this novel makes it slightly less credible, especially today when network computing and data transfer has become very advanced and an everyday regular affair.$my first ever book by a. ghosh and because of this i bought four of his later books over the years. none matched the suspense of the first one, which i read in the hot summer in a poorly air-conditioned texas dorm room. i could almost feel the delirium myself. $i'm finding it very difficult to give a genre label to this work - fantasy, horror, thriller, medical mystery historical fiction - though sci-fi for some reason seems to be its accepted genre. the plot uses a whole lot of themes - science, mysticism, religion, mythology, counter-science, even nihilism to a certain extent. i can't be sure but i also wonder if the author was firing a tiny salvo at a western attitude towards indian scholars, and how history has been written to glorify its authors. (non-objective and not giving credit where due) $if peter weir's movie the last wave (aka black rain) were set in india and involved the study of malaria, and you threw in a little stanislaw lem, and you stuck it all into a set of russian nesting dolls, you might end up with something like the calcutta chromosome. $excellent read. amitav ghosh's portrayl of kolkata is very refreshing and probably lends a good perspective to the various communities which have made kolkata its home during the colonial period.the story in itself is very thrilling and mysterious and keeps one guessing till the end ( unless you read the end first). it is a historical fiction but can be called a ghost story because of the cult which it describes. my take on this book is a four star. a good book to read to pass the time and know kolkata$"
shadow lines,"this was an amazing book that left me blown away by the beautiful vivid storytelling, the insightful analytical commentary and the thought provoking message of the book.the book collapses time and space, placing events from different times and places next to each other. the narrator goes from his experience as a little boy in india to london both through the stories of his uncle and his own experience there as a student. from this narrative structure emerges a powerful message.$i think this is the perfect book. it isn't a novel. it is something beyond what words can comprehend. our lives are made up of memories. maybe proper, maybe improper. this is a live example of that. the strange yet a unique and beautiful way of narration makes the story much more intriguing. it literally goes beyond time and space to build an exquisite stockpile of emotions. a person doesn't read this book, he feels it.$this book was recommended to me by a friend who had simply loved it. she claimed the book to be one that was meant to be read several times, with each reading rendering a deeper understanding and probably a different interpretation. i was naturally curious and wanted to see what she meant by that statement. with that in mind, i promised to read it with her and discuss it. of course, i was really lazy and never got around to reading it, until today$i'm having a hard time figuring out what to say about this. the description and some of the reviews say this is, on the surface, a story of two families - one indian, one english. i found it only the story of the indian family who happened to know the white english family and who occasionally spent time with one or other of them. by that i mean that the indian family sometimes interacted just with themselves, but the white family members interacted only with the indian family members, rather than sometimes just with each other.$i really wanted to like this book. there are some great observations from a child's point of view. there are also some real sentiments from the elderly grandmother teacher. but..i easily put this book down to watch tv, talk to my cat, tweeze my eye brows or anything else. the narrator /main character tells his story in a haphazard fashion, not stream of consciousness. either i couldn't follow him or i didn't care enough to try.i thought it would be nice to read about a middle class indian for a change. the narrator's family was intimately connected with an english middle class family . i didn't find them or their relationship engrossing either.the political upheaval , partition of pakistan, should have been a lightening rod. it was significant , but buried.$"
midnight's children,"midnight's children is not at all a fast read; it actually walks the line of being unpleasantly the opposite. the prose is dense and initially frustrating in a way that seems almost deliberate, with repeated instances of the narrator rambling ahead to a point that he feels is important--but then, before revealing anything of importance, deciding that things ought to come in their proper order. this use of digressions (or, better put, quarter-digressions) can either be attributed to a charmingly distractable narrator or a vehicle for (perhaps cheaply) tantalizing the reader... or both.$this is my absolute favourite rushdie novel. its background of the partition of india and pakistan after the disastrous and cowardly retreat of the british occupiers and the ensuing emergency under indira ghandi provides a breathtaking tableau for rushdie's narrative. his narrator is completely unreliable and that is what makes the story so fascinating. i lend this book out so many times after talking about it so much (and never got my paperback copy returned) that i had to buy a hardcover that i would no longer lend out so as not to lose it anymore. it was the first time i read a book with this kind of narration (mostly having had the omniscient, distant 3rd party narrator or the interior dialog or stream-of-consciousness 1st person narrator) and this was a revelation for me which later led me to read dfw, pynchon and other post-modern writers with relish. a fantastic 20th c masterpiece!$discard skepticism as you approach this epic. suspend disbelief. because myth and truth blend into each other imperfectly to spin a gossamer-fine web of reality on which the nation state is balanced precariously. and we, the legatees of this yarn, are caught up in a surrealist farce which plays out interminably in this land of heat and dust and many smells, our rational selves perennially clashing with our shallow beliefs but eventually succumbing to an incomprehensible love of the absurd. illusion has more to offer than you think.$the narrator, the indian muslim saleem sinai, doesn’t claim to possess the absolute truth of the events that shape the world he lives in, he doesn’t even claim to understand them and so he teases but never poses, he plays with his imagination but never lies about his erratic memory which, either real, inaccurate or both, ends up participating as another fictional character in the story."
train to pakistan,"this book, particularly this version with photographs from margaret bourke-white (a pioneer in photojournalism) was fantastic. it is short but a powerful story about the partition of india in 1947—an event i am sorry to say i had not known much about until coming on this field study to india. i began it on my own train ride to pakistan.$it is interesting to read historical novels where history is written as fiction.here is a novel that tries to record a memorable phase of indian history through fictional route but the essence is hardly lost in the process.....we come to know a village at brink of sutlej that is littered with equal majority of sikhs and muslims living together since a long past ago.that is the time of partition, the summer of 1947. muslims leave india and their exodus to pakistan is not free from human sufferings.and so is the case with hindus and sikhs leaving pakistan.$one of the earliest english language novels to capture the horrors of the indian partition of 1947. since then it has achieved classic status in the history of subcontinental literature and for right reasons.as independence and with it partition took reality the punjabis become desperate to learn about their fate. the province of punjab (like bengal on the eastern borders) was to be cut in half between its muslim majority population and hindu-sikh majority populationv$train to pakistan is a book about the horrors of civil war and how a small peaceful village finally becomes a part of religious hate and communal violence. it depicts the myriads of human emotions which arise in troubled times and portrays how nothing is concrete. khushwant singh makes his point with this book that there is no categorical distinction of a person as good or bad and that even the best of relationships, which are built upon the virtues of comradeship and empathy, can be totally engulfed in troubled times by selfishness, intolerance, hypocrisy and falsehood. it also portrays that the test of ones character is only in tough times- via the contrast of the two lead characters of the novel.$inspite of volumes being written about life before, during and after the indo-pak partition, 'train to pakistan' clearly stands apart. how the brotherhood between two major communities of a small peaceful village transforms to hatred and loathe overnight under the existing scenario, is unbelievably surprising. murders, thefts, molestations, massacres, over just a short span of time are enough to send shivers down your spine.$"
swami and friends,"i would never have known about narayan had not the parent of a child with whom i worked introduced me with a christmas present of the everyman's library edition of the four 'malgugi' novels. another lucky reward of my job. the first of these novels, 'swami' is the story of a ten-year-old boy in a small town in southern india, just as gandhi's independence movement is gaining traction. $this is a beautiful book about childhood, specifically boyhood, told by a master story teller about to begin his long and fruitful creative life.famously, swami and friends is the work which got rk narayan his start, when a friend in london showed the manuscript to graham greene, leading to its publication, after the friend ignored rkn’s instruction to throw the work into the thames.$in fact, i enjoyed reading all of the 19 chapters in the first narayan novel since i'd never read him before. it's one of the novels published in the everyman's library series and i couldn't help admiring him as well as his writing style, narrative and sense of humour to the extent that i could visualize how the rural indians lived in the remote country nearly similar to my rural thailand some 55 years ago.i'm sorry i don't have the everyman's library hardcover nearby, therefore, i can't write my review in more detail in the meantime (i'd definitely write a more in-depth one whenever i can find the copy). in short, find this novel to read and you'd love narayan as one of the pioneering indian writers in the 20th century."
the hungry tide,"if shadow lines enthralled you, amitav ghosh's latest masterpiece, the hungry tide, will sweep you off your feet, and into the precarious waters of the sundarbans.in the typical ghosh style, the narrative moves fluidly between past and present. you will be transported into the mindset of the superstitious yet brave folk, who have adapted themselves to the constant ebb and flow of the tide and are living in continuous fear of the bengal tigers. the tide begins to turn with the advent of two seekers from the outside world - piyali roy, an indian-american marine biologist in search of the irrawaddy dolphins and kanai dutt, an urbane translator from new delhi who's there to retrieve his deceased uncle nirmal's journal.$i know amitav ghosh isn't for everyone, but i just adore his writing. i can't think of another author who can transport me to another place the way he does - whether it's india, somewhere else in asia, the us or the uk. i haven't yet visited the sundarbans, but after reading the hungry tide i feel like i've squelched my toes in the mud and scratched my skin on the mangrove roots of that region.$this book was written well before sea of poppies. it was a fairly interesting story set in an area of eastern india in a ""labyrinth of tiny islands known as the sundarbans, where settlers live in fear of drowning tides and man-eating tigers.""it was almost more of a documentary giving interesting facts about the history of the settlers, how the government fought them using this ground, how they eked out a living there and were sometimes eaten by tigers. dang tigers! $i have mixed feelings about ""the hungry tide."" amitav ghosh tells a large story firmly set in a particular place--the mangrove-covered islands in the estuary of the ganges river. the story has everything: love, class-difference, political conflict, natural and man-made catastrophes, and, of course, dolphins, tigers, and crocodiles (dangerous encounters with the latter two, friendly encounters with the first). and that's the problem."
the guide,"narayan's the guide is a good story about a man who is a tourist guide who does his absolute best to please his customers honestly or dishonestly, as is the nature of tourist guides everywhere. but he is brought low by romance and becomes a bit of a rogue. i don't want to spoil the story by writing out the plot but eventually, from the absolute depths a man can sink to, he rises on the back of being thought a holy man. his innate moral sense overrides his desire for an easier life and he risks all by telling it how it is.$"
